Methodology statements1.SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGEMITIGATION1.1
Work process – conceptual approach
"In the June 2019 report, the TEG explained the process used to assess and select economic activities forinclusion in the Taxonomy. (Shown in Figure 1). The Taxonomy Regulation has not materially changedthe TEG’s thinking on methodology for selecting sectors. Further, the TR takes up the TEG’srecommended approach to identify enabling activities as a type of activity."
Figure 1 Work process for technical screening criteria development
"Identifying priorities within the potential universe of economic activities.The universe of economic activities is described using NACE codes. NACE codes cover 21 broadsectors, with four levels of sub-codes. At the fourth level, 615 classes of economic activity are identified."
- 10 -
"Not all of these sectors, or economic activities, have high emissions 1. Some sectors may haveinsubstantial emissions. Others can enable emitting activities to transition to a low carbon economy.The TEG also recognises that some important activities are not captured by the NACE codes. Forexample: urban and regional planning for low carbon development including avoided journeys, support forlower carbon personal choices such as vegetarian diets, and investments to maintain public naturalcapital such as natural forests and wetlands. Further work is needed to include these in the Taxonomy infuture.The first group of sectors included by the TEG were those with high climate change mitigation need andpotential, on the basis of scope 1 emissions data2. In addition, the TEG considered aspects of B – Miningand Quarrying to the extent these supported activities in C – Manufacturing. However, a full evaluation ofthe mining and quarrying sector was not undertaken.TEG initially used Eurostat emissions inventory data from 2016. More recent emissions data is nowavailable; however, this does not change the findings of the TEG as the sector profile of Europe’semissions was broadly the same in 2016 and 2018.In addition, the TEG recognised that failure to address the carbon performance of buildings, which alonecontribute 36% of CO2e emissions in the EU283, would risk causing harm to climate objectives. Buildingsare not a single economic activity under the NACE system. The TEG’s buildings criteria are designed tobe cross-cutting and apply across the economy, with the exception of explicitly excluded sectors(dedicated storage of fossil fuels). For presentation purposes, the TEG has aligned the building criteriawith NACE codes for construction and real estate activities. However, the buildings criteria are not limitedto these NACE codes and can be applied across other sectors and economic activities.The TEG also considered sectors that could enable a substantial contribution in one of the other selectedsectors. J - Information and Communication and M - Professional, Scientific Technical activities and dueto their potential to be enabling activities. See Table X for a description of enabling activities.The selected macro-sectors represent a minimum of 93.5% of NACE-based scope 1 emissions in the EU(based on 2018 data), although this figure is likely to be an underestimate as it does not considerbuildings emissions in all sectors."
"1 Although they may have substantial impacts on other environmental objectives.TEG’s analysis is based on Scope 1 emissions data as Scope 2 and 3 data by NACE code was not available. However, theTaxonomy recognises energy efficiency improvements consistent with the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation.2"
"3 See https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/buildings. Note that emissions from buildings are considered acrossNACE codes. Emissions from domestic buildings are typically excluded from NACE codes as domestic occupation is not consideredan economic activity. Nonetheless, activities to reduce emissions from the residential sector should be considered in the Taxonomy."

This is reflected in the technical screening criteria for Information and Communications.6 See note on construction."

"Developing criteriaFor each of the activities selected, technical screening criteria have been developed. The format of thetechnical screening criteria has been updated since the June 2019 report to incorporate:"
"a. Principles: The underlying rationale for how the activity will result in a substantialcontribution and/or avoidance of significant harm to the environmental objective in question.b. Criteria: including both metrics and thresholds: The method(s) by which the environmentalperformance of the economic activity will be measured, including defining the boundary forthis measurement and the qualitative or quantitative conditions which must be met to enablethe performance of the activity in a way that is considered environmentally sustainable."
1.2
Defining substantial contribution to climate change mitigation
The Taxonomy Regulation establishes a framework for understanding substantial contributions to climatechange mitigation objectives:
- 14 -
"Article 6Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation1. An economic activity shall be considered to contribute substantially to climate change mitigation wherethat activity substantially contributes to the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in theatmosphere at a level which prevents dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system byavoiding or reducing greenhouse gas emissions or enhancing greenhouse gas removals through any ofthe following means, including through process or product innovation, consistent with the long termtemperature goal of the Paris Agreement:(a) generating, transmitting, storing, distributing or using renewable energy in line with Directive(EU) 2018/2001, including through using innovative technology with a potential for significantfuture savings or through necessary reinforcement or extension of the grid;(b) improving energy efficiency except for power generation activities that are referred to in Article14(2a);(c) increasing clean or climate-neutral mobility;(d) switching to the use of sustainably sourced renewable materials;(e) increasing the use of environmentally safe carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) and carboncapture and storage (CCS) technologies that deliver a net reduction in greenhouse gasemissions;(fa) strengthening land carbon sinks, including through avoided deforestation and forestdegradation, restoration of forests, sustainable management and restoration of croplands,grasslands and wetlands, afforestation, and regenerative agriculture;(g) establishing energy infrastructure required for enabling the decarbonisation of energysystems;(h) producing clean and efficient fuels from renewable or carbon-neutral sources;(i) enabling any of the above in accordance with Article 11a."
"1a. For the purposes of paragraph 1, an economic activity for which there is no technologically andeconomically feasible low carbon alternative, shall be considered to contribute substantially to climatechange mitigation as it supports the transition to a climate-neutral economy consistent with a pathway tolimit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels including by phasing outgreenhouse gas emissions, in particular from solid fossil fuels, where that activity:I.II.III."
has greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performance in thesector or industry;does not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives; anddoes not lead to a lock-in in carbon-intensive assets considering the economic lifetime ofthose assets.
"In addition, the EU has brought forward a proposal for a Climate Law requiring a climate neutral economyby 2050, as well as proposals for interim GHG emissions reductions targets of 50% - 55% by 2030. TEG’srecommendations are aligned with these goals."
- 15 -
1.3
Eligibility of finance for activities contributing substantially to mitigation
"The following table has been updated since the June 2019 report to show how to consider different typesof investment and finance as Taxonomy eligible. The update is to more clearly align with the TaxonomyRegulation which clearly identifies enabling activities, reflecting the TEG recommendation. We now referto the two activity types as either: An activity which has a substantial contribution due to its ownperformance – referring to the operations within the activity, reflecting the activity boundary for thetechnical screening criteria; or an Activity Enabling Mitigation in another economic activity.This table also demonstrates how activities that contribute to transition (Transition Activities in theTaxonomy Regulation) are still expected to substantially contribute to climate mitigation objectives andmeet Taxonomy thresholds. This was identified as the third activity type in the June 2019 TEG report."
1.4
Further development
The sectors identified using this methodology are the critical sectors which need to decarbonise toachieve the EU’s 2030 and 2050 climate goals. They represent the overwhelming majority of European
- 16 -
"emissions7. They are consistent with a broader global consensus and reflect the priority sectors identifiedfor real-economy reform under the European Green Deal 8.On this basis, the TEG recommends that the Platform on Sustainable Finance prioritise full evaluation ofexisting sectors selected rather than the immediate expansion of the sectors covered. However, thePlatform on Sustainable Finance should continue to monitor sectoral emissions in case of materialchanges in the underlying data.The TEG also recognises that some important activities are not captured by the NACE codes. Forexample: urban and regional planning for low carbon development including avoided journeys, support forlower carbon personal choices such as vegetarian diets, and investments to maintain public naturalcapital such as natural forests and wetlands. Further work is needed to include these in the Taxonomy infuture.The activities identified by the TEG using this methodology reflect the majority – but not all – of theeconomic activities which can avoid significant harm or substantially contribute to climate changemitigation. In some cases, the TEG was not able to fully evaluate the potential contribution of a sub-sectorwith the resources available, in the timeframe available. The TEG therefore recommends that thePlatform on Sustainable Finance undertake further evaluation of activities within the existing sectors, witha particular focus on:"

2.SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGEADAPTATIONThe methodology for identifying activities that provide a substantial contribution to adaptation has notchanged since the publication of the taxonomy report in June 2019. The substantial contribution criteriafor adaptation have not changed in nature but have been made consistent with the final regulationproposals of December 2019.
2.1
Work process – conceptual approach
"The proposed approach for an adaptation taxonomy recognises that adaptation is context- and locationspecific and requires the use of a process-based approach to determine if an activity contributes toadaptation and broader system’s climate resilience. The following two-step process aims to demonstratethat an activity contributes to a substantial reduction of the negative effects of climate change:a. Assessing the expected negative physical effects of climate change on the underlying economicactivity that is the focus of resilience-building efforts, drawing on robust evidence and leveragingappropriate climate information;b. Demonstrating how the economic activity will address the identified negative physical effects ofclimate change or will prevent an increase or shifting of these negative physical effects.The assessment of the contribution of the activity will vary based on its scope (asset, corporate, sector ormarket), as well as spatial and temporal scale. Moreover, the proposed approach recognises that anadaptation activity may target an entity (e.g. a corporation or a city) and/or a market, sector, or region.Activity-level adaptation aims at strengthening an asset or economic activity to withstand identifiedphysical climate risks over its lifetime, such as considering sea-level rise in the design of a bridge.Systemic adaptation aims to actively reduce vulnerability and build resilience of a wider system, orsystems, such as a community, ecosystem, or city.The TEG recognises that climate change will affect all sectors of an economy and all sectors must adaptto its impacts globally. As a result, the adaptation taxonomy is a set of guiding principles and qualitativescreening criteria, which can be applied in any economic activity in any location. It is, therefore, the viewof the TEG that these criteria are globally relevant.Differences between climate change adaptation and mitigationThe context-specific nature of adaptation means that it is not possible to produce a stand-alone andexhaustive list of activities that could be viewed as contributing to adaptation under all circumstances.Instead of a list of adaptation activities, a set of guiding principles and screening criteria is used to assessthe potential contribution of an economic activity to adapt to climate change and increase climateresilience. To aid users of the Taxonomy, the TEG has also developed an indicative framework forclassification of climate-related hazards and a climate sensitivity matrix for specific economic activities(see Classification of climate-related hazards and Sectoral climate sensitivity matrices).There are fundamental differences between climate change adaptation activities and mitigation activities.For mitigation activities, a one-tonne reduction of CO2 emissions has the same impact regardless ofwhere the mitigation activity takes place. It is therefore possible to define lists of activities that are"

"deemed to support climate change mitigation. Adaptation responds to physical climate risks that aremostly location and context specific. For example, there are in principle several engineering and nonengineering options available to a coastal city to respond to the risk resulting from increased sea level.Responses will vary according to where the city is located, its size, the institutional and financial capacityof the city administration to deal with climate risk, the technical and engineering expertise available, thepriority of the city, the perception of the citizens, and other factors. The adaptation responses will benefitthe city that adopts them and possibly the systems that depend or interact with the city.Type of technical screening criteriaThe proposed approach is based on qualitative screening to identify activities that contribute toadaptation. Qualitative screening criteria allow for a structured process-based approach to determine if aneconomic activity contributes to adaptation. As measured baselines or accepted metrics for adaptationhave not yet been developed, an established methodology for defining quantitative screening criteria foradaptation and defined adaptation targets at the national, sectoral, or subnational level do not exist. Evenwith the availability of methodologies, targets or baselines, quantitative screening criteria could excludesmall-scale activities that may deliver significant climate-resilience benefits in specific contexts.The interaction of climate exposure, resources and socioeconomic characteristics related to a specificeconomic activity will determine the nature and scale of adaptation that would be appropriate.Scope of the Adaptation TaxonomyThe Adaptation Taxonomy covers 68 economic activities, which were originally selected for their potentialto deliver a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. The application of the adaptationtaxonomy beyond these activities is only constrained by the lack of availability of DNSH criteria for theother five environmental objectives covered by the Taxonomy.A number of economic activities that might be important for climate adaptation are not yet included in theeconomic activities currently addressed in the Taxonomy. The application of the taxonomy will beexpanded to more economic activities as criteria for DNSH to other environmental objectives aredeveloped.In that respect, the TEG recommends that the economic activities listed in the table below be prioritisedfor further work on DNSH criteria to the other environmental objectives because of their high potential fora substantial contribution to adaptation.The TEG gave close consideration to the inclusion of two of these economic activities into the Taxonomyfor this report: namely, research & development and Telecommunications, computer programming andinformation. The TEG’s analysis on these issues can be found in the section titled “Additional adaptationactivities for further consideration”. However, on due reflection the view was taken that furtherconsideration of the DNSH criteria for these activities would be needed before this could be done.The TEG also recommends that the platform review the proposed DNSH criteria for Non-Life Insurance(65.12) and Engineering Activities and Related Technical Consultancy Dedicated to Adaptation to ClimateChange (71.12) as a matter of priority. These criteria are conservative in that they recognise serviceprovision only to activities themselves eligible under the Taxonomy. It may be preferable to simplify thecriteria to increase coverage and enhance usability."

Defining substantial contribution to climate change adaptation
Interpreting the regulation in respect of climate change adaptationThe proposed regulation establishes a framework for understanding substantial contributions to climatechange adaptation objectives. This definition is broadly consistent with that provided by theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.9
"9 The IPCC provides the following definition of adaptation in their 5th Assessment Report: ‘The process of adjustment to actual orexpected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities.In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects’.

"Article 7Substantial contribution to climate change adaptation1. An economic activity shall be considered to contribute substantially to climate change adaptationwhere:a. that economic activity includes adaptation solutions that either substantially reduce therisk of adverse impact or substantially reduces the adverse impact of the current andexpected future climate on that economic activity itself without increasing the risk of anadverse impact on other people, nature and assets; or whereb. that economic activity provides adaptation solutions that, in addition to the conditions laiddown in Article 11a, contribute substantially to preventing or reducing the risk of adverseimpact or substantially reduces the adverse impact of the current and expected futureclimate on other people, nature or assets, without increasing the risk of an adverseimpact on other people, nature and assets."
"1.a The adaptation solutions referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 shall be assessed and prioritisedusing the best available climate projections and shall, as a minimum, prevent or reduce:(a) The location-specific and context-specific adverse impact of climate change on theeconomic activity; or(b) The adverse impact that climate change may have on the environment within which theeconomic activity takes place"
"The adverse impact of climate change considered for the development of the taxonomy include impactresulting from both chronic or slow onset climate-related hazards (such as average temperature increaseand sea level rise) and rapid or acute climate related hazards (such as extreme rainfall, storm surges,flooding, and heat waves).In this report, material physical climate risk is the risk of (financial and non-financial) losses occurring dueto performance failures, performance delays or incomplete performance of an economic activity resultingfrom climate-related hazards.With that in mind, the adaptation taxonomy comprises two types of substantial contribution to adaptationobjectives:1. Adapted activities: an economic activity is adapted to all material physical climate risks identifiedfor the economic activity to the extent possible and on a best effort basis; and/or2. Activities enabling adaptation of an economic activity: the activity reduces material physicalclimate risk in other economic activities and/or addresses systemic barriers to adaptation, and isitself also adapted to physical climate risks.Both types of activities must also meet the criteria for Do No Significant Harm to other environmentalobjectives and comply with minimum social safeguards established for the Taxonomy. Activities adaptedto climate change and activities enabling adaptation of other economic activities provide a positiveenvironmental impact by meeting a set of technical criteria for substantial contribution to adaptation and a"

Figure 3 Decision tree for substantial contribution to climate change adaptation
"This is consistent with the approach taken when identifying economic activities that substantiallycontribute to climate change mitigation in terms of “mitigated activity” and “activity enabling mitigation”.The first set of economic activities contribute to adaptation via adopting solutions that ensure that theeconomic activity can perform well under a changing climate. This contribution to adaptation usuallyoccurs in economic activities that have a primary objective other than climate change adaptation. Forexample, a transmission line for the distribution of electricity to an urban area is made more climateresilient to the expected increase in temperature by installing conductors with operating limits at highertemperature thresholds. Efforts to identify and reduce physical climate risks to an economic activityshould be based on a best effort basis, recognising that it is not possible to reduce physical climate risk tozero. The characteristics of risks to an economic activity are increasingly difficult to predict over long timehorizons because of the uncertainties associated with future changes in the climate. As a result,adaptation of an economic activity requires a proportionate, flexible and an iterative risk managementapproach that can be adjusted over time.The second set of economic activities contribute to adaptation via enabling the adaptation of othereconomic activities. For example, the construction of a flood protection system is performed to reduce therisk of flood for a facility or a city and the economic activities that take place in it. Similarly, the research,"

"development and commercialisation of drought-resistant crop varieties will help ensure crop productionyields despite increased risk of droughts.Solutions that support adapted activities and economic activities enabling adaptation are clearly linkedand may overlap. However, the distinction between these two types of adaptation activities can guidedifferent user types. Adapting an economic activity captures the solutions required by actors to increasetheir own resilience, whilst enabling activities capture the research, development, marketing, andinstallation of solutions that will help other entities to adapt. For example, a water utility vulnerable toincreased risk of floods may adopt early warning systems to reduce this risk, and this would count as partof the programme of solutions that entity is taking to ensure their activity is adapted to climate change, i.e.part of their response to adapting that economic activity. However, a small or medium-sized enterprise(SME) developing the technology for flood early warning systems to support adaptation of other sectors,including by the water utility company. This activity of the technology developer is therefore counted as‘enabling adaptation’. This example is illustrated in Figure 8 below.Taxonomy users"

"Some of the economic activities currently addressed in the Taxonomy might often fall under the categoryof ‘adapted activities’, others might be ‘activities enabling adaptation’. There will be activities that can beeither type depending on their purpose and the context within which the activity takes place. What is keyis the primary objective of the actor engaged in that activity. For this reason, the economic activities arenot a priori categorised into ‘Adapted activity’ and/or ‘Activity enabling adaptation’, this is left to thediscretion of the user."

"For example, Conservation Forestry could be deemed to be an activity enabling adaptation if the primaryobjective of the conservation activity is to support the adaptation of other economic activities or actorse.g. to prevent soil erosion damaging agricultural production or threatening local settlements or watersupplies. Conversely, Conservation Forestry where the primary purpose is to promote biodiversity maybe treated as an ‘adapted activity’ if they are at the same time ensuring that those forests are resilient toclimate change risks. This is a difficult line to drawn given the inter-relationships and co-benefits betweenthese objectives. In such cases, users are asked to identify and justify whether their activity should beviewed as an ‘adapted activity’ or an ‘activity enabling adaptation of other economic activities’ and meetthe appropriate criteria accordingly.Alternatively, construction of a new building (NACE code F41 or F43) could be deemed to be an ‘activityenabling adaptation’ if the building is specifically purposed for adaptation and resilience, e.g. shelters orsafe buildings for evacuation from flooding/typhoons. (This is not unusual in countries like Bangladeshand the Philippines, though not common practice in Europe). But where not specifically purposed,construction of a new building would only make a substantial contribution to adaptation via becoming an‘adapted activity’.Guiding principles for substantial contributions to climate change adaptationThe TEG proposes the following guiding principles to identify an economic activity that substantiallycontributes to climate change adaptation:Principle 1: The economic activity reduces all material physical climate risks to the extentpossible and on a best effort basis."
"In the case of an adapted economic activity, the activity integrates measures aimed at reducingall material physical climate risks to that activity as identified through an assessment of risksposed by both current weather variability and expected future climate change. The assessmentshould take into account chronic and acute climate-related hazards and associated physicalclimate risks across a range of scenarios, and account for uncertainty. It should considergeographic and temporal scales that are appropriate for the economic activity."

"In the case of ‘an economic activity enabling adaptation, the activity reduces material risks toother economic activities and/or addresses systemic barriers to adaptation, for example through adedicated asset, technology, service or product, and itself integrates measures aimed at reducingmaterial risks where applicable (e.g. in the case of a dedicated asset)."
Principle 2: The economic activity does not adversely affect adaptation efforts by others.
"Economic activities and the measures taken to address the material climate risks facing thoseactivities should be consistent with adaptation needs in the applicable sector or region,considering opportunities to build resilience outside of the premises of a single activity. Thosemeasures should also not increase the risk of an adverse impact on other people, nature andassets in terms of hindering adaptation efforts by others for example by shifting impacts faced byothers"
Principle 3: The economic activity has adaptation-related outcomes that can be defined andmeasured using adequate indicators.
- 24 -

"When possible, the outcomes of adaptation activities should be monitored and measured againstdefined indicators for adaptation results. If possible, updated assessments of physical climaterisks should be undertaken at the appropriate frequency (e.g. every five or ten years) dependingon the risks, the context and the availability of new information, technologies or approaches orpolicies and regulations."
"2.3Screening criteria for activities making a substantial contribution toadaptationWhile the principles describe the foundations and qualities underpinning economic activities thatcontribute to climate change adaptation, the screening criteria are specific characteristics that can beused to determine whether an economic activity provides a substantial contribution to adaptation. Thesescreening criteria vary between ‘adapted’ activities and activities that enable adaptation. These criteriahave been updated since the June 2019 report.Screening criteria for ‘adapted activities’ an economic activityTable 3 Screening criteria for substantial contribution: adapted activities"

2.4
Eligibility of finance for activities contributing substantially to adaptation
"In the case of an economic activity enabling adaptation, the revenue and/or expenditure associated withthe economic activity that meets the relevant screening criteria is considered as eligible.In the case of an adapted economic activity, at this time, only the costs of adaptation can be counted, notthe revenues and/ or expenditure associated with the whole activity. This is because adaptation of aneconomic activity is delivered in activities that have primary objectives other than adaptation (for exampleadaptation of an electricity transmission line to increased risk of flood). When those activities are adaptedto cope with physical climate risk, they contribute to the climate resilience of the entire, highly integratedand interconnected economic system and as a result, deliver a global benefit through aggregatedadaptation in all sectors of an economy. However, methodologies, tools and metrics to measure theseclimate resilience benefits remain under development. These technical limitations mean that countingonly the costs of adaptation of the economic activity is the most viable, conservative option today.In some circumstances, investments required to adapt an economy activity may be large andimplemented in phases as part of an adaptation plan, which has been developed in response to a climaterisk assessment. In these circumstances, investments in measures included in a full programme ofactions that collectively reduce the material physical climate risks to the economic activity can be countedin phases, even if the whole adaptation plan has not been executed. It is expected that the fullprogramme of measures would be executed over a period of time no longer than 5 years.It is proposed that, as a matter of priority, the Platform undertake further work to develop approaches formeasuring the climate resilience benefits of adapted economic activities. This is a key step in movingtowards recognising all revenue and/or expenditure associated with an economic activity that is adaptedto cope with physical climate risk and yields high climate resilience benefits."

2.5
Classification of climate-related hazards
"The TEG has developed a classification of climate-related hazards. When developing the Taxonomy, theclimate-related hazards considered are limited to the potential occurrence of a weather and climaterelated natural physical event or trend12.The climate-related hazard classification comprises four major hazard groups, with hazards related towater, temperature, wind, and mass-movements. All groups include acute (extreme) and chronic (slowonset) hazards, as adaptation must account for both rapid as well as gradual changes in the weather andclimate to take the appropriate adaptation measures and avoid maladaptation.13This analysis focusses on the most important or significant hazards and is designed to guide the user toconsider the most salient physical risks when mapping the sensitivities of a given sector.All secondary hazards14 resulting from climate-related hazards (including but not limited to chemical,biological, ecological and epidemiological hazards) are excluded. It is however advisable to assess therisk of such secondary hazards and consider measures to address them for each economic activity."

Geophysical and technological hazards are outside the domain of adaptation to climate change.14 As an example, new biological pests or increased prevalence of existing pests can result from changing temperatures. Forestsand agriculture are typically sensitive to warmer (minimum) temperatures and, in this example, their effects on pests. In this case,the changing prevalence of pests is a secondary hazard against which adaptation measures may be needed."

DNSH to climate change adaptation
"Per Article 12 of the Taxonomy regulation, an economic activity shall be considered as significantlyharming climate change adaptation “where that activity leads to an increased adverse impact of thecurrent and expected climate, on itself or for other people, nature and assets”.In terms of what constitutes or leads to an increased negative effect of climate by an economic activity forand beyond the environment within which that economy activity takes place, it is proposed that the DNSHto adaptation criteria should ensure that both:"
"The services that economic activities/ vulnerable populations/ vulnerable ecosystems rely on need tobe resilient to climate change. If they are not and those services are significantly curtailed due toclimate change impacts, the resilience and ability to adapt of those activities/ populations/ecosystems is weakened. This can be achieved by ensuring that all material risks to the economicactivity itself have been reduced to the extent possible and on a best effort basis."
- 29 -
Those services are not being delivered in a way that adversely affects the adaptation efforts of others.
"Discussion was had on whether compliance with these requirements should be determined on a case-bycase basis through an activity and context specific assessment, or whether an a-priori activity only levelassessment is needed. As discussed above, adaptation needs and impacts of activities on adaptationand resilience are context specific and therefore a context specific assessment is needed.For these reasons, the two criteria described in Table 6 are proposed for “DNSH to adaptation” for alleconomic activities. In addition to these criteria, the TEG has considered where there are any examplesof tools, methodology or other guidance that might be of use in applying these two criteria in the contextof a specific economic activity. Where such examples have been identified, they have been noted in theDNSH to Adaptation section of the appropriate economic activity.It is noted that for new economic activities, the following criteria must be met at the point of design andconstruction. For existing activities and associated assets, where addressing physical climate risksrequires a retrofit of some kind, all material physical climate risks must be assessed and adaptationmeasures required to address them must be identified and programmed with a clear and time limitedexecution plan no longer than 5 years.Table 6 – Do no significant harm to adaptation: ‘adapted economic activities’"

"In addition, the regulation specifies that for all objectives: the environmental impacts of the activity itself,as well as of the products and services provided by that activity throughout their life cycle shall be takeninto account, notably by considering their production, use and end-of life.The technical screening criteria proposed by the TEG contain quantitative thresholds where possible.Where this is not possible, the criteria are qualitative, describing an action or set of actions to bedemonstrated which avoid significant harm.The baseline scenario for the economic activities is compliance with relevant EU environmentallegislation. To this end, the criteria take into account existing EU legislation. The call for additionalexpertise to inform the TEG and the process described below enabled the establishment of criteria basedon available scientific evidence. Where evidence was not conclusive, the precautionary principleenshrined in article 191 TFEU was taken into account, as required in Article 14 of the draft regulation.To the extent possible, the screening criteria, whether qualitative or quantitative, were selected tofacilitate the verification of compliance. In many instances, the proposed criteria are expressed in terms ofcompliance with relevant EU legislation and/or associated reference information, such as the bestavailable techniques (BAT) reference documents (also known as ‘BREFs’). 15The technical screening criteria (TSC) processFigure 9 presents an overview of the process for development of DNSH technical screening criteriaagainst activities expected to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. For eachactivity, the scope was reviewed to identify life cycle aspects and activity boundaries. Where linkages withother activities occurred (i.e. where life cycle aspects overlapped with other activities), this has beenreferenced in the analysis.1."

"Life cycle thinking. A life cycle approach was adopted to establish the technical screeningcriteria for DNSH in accordance with Article 14.1(f) of the Taxonomy proposal.16 This approachprovided a robust way to avoid errors such as considering sustainable any economic activity thatmay have negative effects during its upstream or downstream stages. Questions asked andresolved included:a. what would generate significant harm during the life cycle of the activity?ANDb. can this risk be addressed by complying with EU legislation and best practices,international standards or guidelines?"
3.
"Sectoral activities with high mitigation potential not included in the Taxonomy. Where‘significant harm’ to one or more environmental objectives by the activity cannot be avoidedthrough TEG requirements, the activity was not included in the Taxonomy. Material issueswhereby an activity is considered unsuitable for inclusion in the Taxonomy may include but arenot limited to: lack of empirical data for reasonable evaluation of DNSH (in line with theprecautionary approach), lock-in and intergenerational risks."
4.
"Evaluate and document key findings from relevant research and technical publications.Authoritative publications were reviewed to gain a comprehensive understanding of potentialenvironmental exposures, and to identify material exposures for further consideration which maynot be captured in existing EU legislation, BEMP, BAT and BREF."
5.
"EU environmental acquis. Protection of the environmental objectives relating to waterresources, circular economy, pollution prevention and the control and protection of ecosystems isadvanced at the EU level with associated methodologies and thresholds, as contained in theexisting body of EU environmental law (i.e. the environmental acquis). 17 Existing EU legalrequirements apply across the Taxonomy. Therefore, for an activity to be included, it must atminimum comply with EU legal requirements, as well as national legal requirements andrequirements relating to the environmental permits needed for its operation. EU legalrequirements were considered as minimum requirements and were in general not repeated in theDNSH evaluation. When an environmental impact was considered significant, the relevant EUlegal requirements (including BREF) and/or national requirements were included in the DNSHcriteria, unless more specific requirements were deemed necessary to avoid significant harm."

Global Context. The Taxonomy can potentially be used for economic activities outside of the EU.The technical screening criteria for DNSH provide necessary performance levels or thresholds forEU issued financial products.
"16 Article 14.1(f) states: The technical screening criteria adopted in accordance with Articles 6(2), 7(2), 8(2), 9(2), 10(2) and 11(2)shall take into account the environmental impacts of the economic activity itself, as well as of the products and services provided bythat economic activity, notably by considering their production, use and end-of-life.17 Access to EU environmental legislative and policy summaries is available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/browse/summaries.html."

"Splitting DNSH criteria. The scope of activities taken into consideration for DNSH mirrors themitigation scope of activities. However, for a small number of activities two or three differing setsof DNSH criteria were deemed necessary. As an example, within the manufacturing macrosector, NACE code 20.13: Manufacture of other inorganic basic chemicals, there is one set ofmitigation criteria and three sets of DNSH criteria divided into soda ash, carbon black andchlorine."

"Selection of technical screening criteria. The ‘do no significant harm’ evaluation focussed onlyon the most significant aspects of concern and developed threshold screening criteria where:a. avoiding significant harm requires criteria that differ from EU legislationb. alignment with international standards, laws, conventions and the global SDGs wasconsidered necessaryc. issues were identified as most significant in a global context, even if resolved at theEuropean leveld. special care was needed to address local geographical/physical, climatological and/orhydrological conditionse. other sectoral specific aspects concerning one or more of the DNSH objectives, asdetailed in the rationale, were found"

Use of NACE
"This report uses NACE for industry classification and the TEG has developed screening criteria for prioritysectors within NACE. Other activities may be also eligible, so long as the company or investor candemonstrate compliance with the substantial contribution criteria and that no significant harm has beendone to any other environmental objective.Examples of these include:ManufacturingFor some corporates who manufacture as well as sell the end products, they may attribute revenue to theend product rather than to the manufacturing process. Technical screening criteria in this report lays outexpectations of the manufacturing process. When aligning testing criteria to manufacturing, it may benecessary to review revenue classified to the sale of the end product by the same organisation, eventhough the eligible activity would be assessed within the manufacturing processes.

"When considering an activity that does not align with the provided NACE codes, it may be possible thatthe activities of that corporate can still make a substantial contribution to one or more of theenvironmental objectives. This activity can be considered eligible, so long as the testing criteria that existwithin the report are satisfied.ConstructionActivities of main and secondary building contractors can be found within NACE 43, with additionalsub-sectors under NACE 42. The activities of these companies could be considered eligible (as enablingactivities) if they contribute to construction activities that comply with the taxonomy criteria set under ‘NewConstructions and Renovations’. Eligibility would need to be assessed on a project-by-project basis, as acontractor would have different projects within their portfolio of work, some complying with the taxonomyand others not.Activities of manufacturers of building products and machinery (sub-sectors within NACE 16, 23and 28) could be considered eligible (as enabling activities) if they produce low carbon technologies forbuildings (for example, efficient windows, insulation etc.) and comply with the criteria set out within themanufacturing section of this report.Real estate brokers and agencies (NACE 68.31) activities could be considered eligible (as EnablingActivities) if they support the acquisition of properties that comply with the criteria set for “calculatedperformance” in acquisition & ownership, but this would have to be assessed and disclosed on anacquisition-by-acquisition basis.Property management (NACE 68.32) - Activities of these companies could be considered eligible (asEnabling Activities) if they satisfy the criteria for “measured performance” set in Acquisition & Ownership;compliance would have to be assessed on a property-by-property basis."

Assessing the Taxonomy criteria for Green Debt and Loans
"Green debt or lending activities may be allocated a NACE or equivalent industry classification code.Where financial instruments are allocated a NACE listed in this report, the substantial contribution andsignificant harm tests can be applied as listed. However, there may be some examples where the activitymay be suitable to test, even if the industry or sector of the overall business may not be listed within thisreport. Such examples include:"
"Multi-sector eligibilityWhere the proceeds of a bond or loan are allocated to a project, and the project is allocated across morethan one sector (e.g. solar, hydro and wind investments), then each of the projects or assets shall meetthe specific eligibility criteria provided within this taxonomy report (Production of Electricity fromHydropower, Solar PV or Wind Power). If the capital allocation to the projects was split evenly across thethree activities and only one of the projects satisfied the technical screening criteria, then only 33% of theinvestment would qualify."
- 37 -
"Sector alignmentWhere the proceeds of a bond or loan are allocated to a project or asset that sits outside of the normalindustry classification of the asset owner (e.g. Agricultural upgrade of farming vehicles to electricvehicles), then the nature of the project or asset needs to be assessed in line with the appropriatetaxonomy testing criteria. In this example, the assets (electric vehicles) would qualify under Transport (<50g CO2/Km) even though the bond or loan may be classified under Agriculture.Where a corporate in an industry not covered within this report wishes to invest in new infrastructure thatwould enable more energy efficiency in their process, and those projects allow the corporate to meet thetechnical screening criteria, then they would qualify. Demonstration of the technical screening criteria metwould be required in the associated prospectus."

FORESTRY
"Why forestry is included in the TaxonomyThe Taxonomy defines forest in accordance with the definitions of the UN Food and AgricultureOrganization.18 In this context, a forest is considered as “Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with treeshigher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholdsin situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.” (UNFAO,2019)19. In the context of the Taxonomy, plantations forests are specifically excluded. Plantations aredefined by the FAO as “Planted Forest that is intensively managed and meet ALL the following criteria atplanting and stand maturity: one or two species, even age class, and regular spacing. 1. Specificallyincludes: short rotation plantation for wood, fibre and energy; 2 Specifically excludes: forest planted forprotection or ecosystem restoration; 3. Specifically excludes: Forest established through planting orseeding which at stand maturity resembles or will resemble naturally regenerating forest. Recognisingthat countries or country groups may set specific definitions of forest to represent specific regionalconditions, the Taxonomy allows for the use of forest definitions developed under regional processes,such as Forest Europe, and various agreements, such as the International Tropical Timber Agreementetc., providing that these are aligned with the FAO definition. When applying to be Taxonomy aligned, thespecific definition (if different from FAO) should be set out and the alignment with FAO definitiondemonstrated clearly.For the purposes of the Taxonomy, significant mitigation achievement for Forestry is judged throughimprovement in activities’ own performance, with a focus on the maintenance of forest carbon stocks andsinks and increase of sequestration potential within the sector. Forests cover around 30% of the globallandmass (in Europe this figure is higher at ~40-45%) and absorb roughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxideeach year.20 Forests regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity, play an integral part in the carbon cycle,support livelihoods and can help drive sustainable growth. EU forests already account for more than 20%of the global forest carbon sink, and yet an increase in carbon sequestration from forests is essential tothe achievement of a net-zero target by 2050 in Europe and globally.21Given the necessity to maintain the existing forest carbon sink, conservation finance is enabled within theforest sector, i.e. finance that supports the maintenance and protection of forest areas, regardless ofwhether they are used for economic production. The introduction of conservation forests that may haveno productive function, into the Taxonomy should aid in the alignment of the Taxonomy as it develops toinclude substantial contribution to other environmental objectives."

"Approximately 48% (191 Mt) of the biomass produced from EU forests is consumed as energy, with theremaining 52% (209 Mt) used in its material form (Camia et al, 2018)22. It is important to recognise thatthese two figures are not mutually independent and that the energy end use of forest biomass seldomarise solely from whole trees harvested for that purpose. The Taxonomy recognises the principles putforward in the EU Forestry Strategy, advancing both the benefits of sustainable forest management andthe multifunctional role of forests.23Despite this split between material and energy use, in the context of the bioeconomy the revenue andemployment generated from the two uses is significantly different. 1.8% of the overall EU bioeconomyrevenue is generated from the energetic use of biomass compared to 27% for material production.Forestry as an employment sector adds a further 2.2% (EEA, 2018)24.Forests are exposed to the effects of climate change such as changes in weather patterns (e.g. extremeheatwaves), and pest and diseases outbreaks. In Europe alone, more wildfires have been recorded in thefirst four months of 2019 than in the whole of 2018 25 and while in the EU the forest area is increasing; onthe global scale deforestation remains the second-leading cause of climate change, after the burning offossil fuels.26 The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) estimates thatan additional USD 14 billion in financial flows will be required to address climate impacts in agriculture,forestry and fisheries globally in 2030.27 That includes the implementation of mitigation projects, but alsoensuring the resilience of forests to climatic changes, the pro-active protection of forest ecosystems,biodiversity, habitats and soil, as well as the sustainable provision of raw material for the forest-basedindustry. The Taxonomy recognises the impact of climate conditions and changing environments itincludes a clause for force majeure that states that underperformance resulting from natural disturbancecan be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds - and will not result in noncompliance with the Taxonomy criteria28.The role of forests in the global greenhouse gas balance can be enhanced through the implementation ofcost-effective mitigation options within the forestry sector (greening of), including: rehabilitation ofdegraded forests, reforestation, sustainable forest management, conservation and afforestation.

"forest sector, such as agriculture or urban expansion. 29,30 Forest based products can have climatemitigation benefits when used in other economic sectors (enabling), through the reduction of GHGemissions and substitution effects. Two forms of ‘substitution’ are foreseen. The substitution of GHGintensive materials with harvested wood products (HWP) (e.g. wood-based raw materials and productsused in construction), and the substitution of fossil-based fuels. These two forms of substitution differmaterially in their impact on GHG emissions and approach to Carbon reductions. At this point, theforest Taxonomy focuses on ‘greening of’ activities, to protect and enhance forest carbon stocksand sinks. It is recommended that the Commission consider how “enabling” activities involvinglong-lived and harvested wood products could operate within the Taxonomy. A proposal forconsiderations for the Taxonomy set out in Annex F1.Subjects coveredThe scope of the Taxonomy emphasizes carbon sequestration and carbon storage in forests throughforest management activities that apply up to the forest gate. The selected activities representinterventions at different stages of a forest’s economic life cycle and have been scoped under the NACEcode A2 - Forestry and logging. They include:"
"Afforestation (FAO FRA 2020 Definition): the establishment of forest through planting and/ordeliberate seeding on land that, until then, was under a different land use, implies a transformation ofland use from non-forest to forest."
"Reforestation (FAO FRA 2020 Definition): the re-establishment of forest through planting and/ordeliberate seeding on land classified as forest. The FAO FRA definition of reforestation excludesnatural regeneration. However, the Taxonomy recognises the importance of natural regeneration tothe increased carbon sink and stock potential provided by forests in general. It is therefore includedexplicitly within this context in line with the FAO FRA definition of naturally regenerating forest 31."
Restoration/rehabilitation: any intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of anecosystem from a degraded state.

"Due to changes in practices in the category “afforestation” and “reforestation”, which changes frompractices connected with newly established forest to first tending operations, it is proposed to transferthese two categories to the NACE category “existing forest management” or “conservation forestry”(depending on the objective of the management) after the 20 years period, following the EU LULUCF"

"accounting rule of 20 years. Similarly, if there is large-scale harvesting, the NACE category will move fromexisting forest management to that of reforestation. Within the EU, reforestation after harvesting is arequirement, yet this is not the situation globally. The Taxonomy adds value in this way in the globalcontext. Conservation forests may arise in a variety of forms (such as designation, or voluntaryconservation) and may be considered similar to the “existing forest management” NACE in the context ofthe Taxonomy. The relationship with the other forest NACE is as follows. Where conservation ceases tobe the primary objective of the management of the stand, the NACE will move to “existing forestmanagement”. Where there is a significant loss of forest (for example fire or storm damage), the NACEactivity for ensuring substantial contribution to mitigation will become “reforestation” or“rehabilitation/restoration” until 20 years at which point the NACE will become “conservation forest” againor “existing forest management” – depending on the objective of the forest management at that time.Harvesting practices, such as thinning, removals, final fellings, etc. will temporarily reduce the carbonstock and the potential to sequester carbon. However, such forest management activities should beeligible under Taxonomy, as long as SFM practices are in place; and that carbon sinks of above andbelow ground carbon are maintained or increased, over the rotation period of the forest; or whereselective removal of trees is required as part of the forest conservation plan. The rotation period is heredefined as the time from seeding, planting or natural regeneration through to the point of harvest."
"Criteria and thresholdsSelected criteria build on existing EU legislation (e.g. the Renewable Energy Directive and its recast, EULULUCF, EU Nature Directives, EU FLEGT, EU Timber Regulation, etc.), national forest legislation,international standards and best practices and international processes, such as the MinisterialConference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (Forest Europe). The Taxonomy recognizes that,although the EU has a variety of forest-related policies, the Treaty on the Functioning of the EuropeanUnion makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy, and that the responsibility forforests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights, whichinclude a long history of long-term planning in national and regional regulations.The Taxonomy sets out the following three qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensuresustainable management of forest areas; a measured baseline for progress towards substantialmitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative (increasing) (and/or maintained in the caseof existing forest management) and permanent. All three criteria are required to demonstrate sustainableand substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are:1. Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements in order toensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and forest services.SFM is defined as ‘the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate,that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential tofulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national,and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems’. 33 The SFMrequirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibility for the adoption of"

"approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified), and applyinternationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemes that areregularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors and forestmanagement companies to verify compliance with the criteria in Europe and globally. 34 Thepractices set out in Annex F2 represent a non-exhaustive list of activities that would, ifimplemented effectively, lead to the achievement of the objectives of the Taxonomy in the contextof maintain and increase carbon stocks, and conservation of non-productive functions. The aim ofthe list is to provide support to operators and investors as to the types of practice that should beimplemented. Recognising the different conditions and characteristics of regions and forestsanother practice could be applied and can be demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the sameoutcome.Criterion 1 differs in the context of conservation forests as a result of those forests having adefined conservation objective and where timber production is not the primary objective. TheTaxonomy recognises that its initial goal is to deliver substantial mitigation, and thus forconservation forests focusses on the maintenance of the forest carbon sink. A forest conservationplan is required in order to ensure that substantial mitigation is delivered (in this casemaintenance and increase of carbon sinks) in line with wider conservation objectives. This differsfrom the requirements under the other forest NACE, in that there may be zero interventionrequirements, and/or requires only those management activities listed under Category C in AnnexF2. Any necessary harvesting (for example diseased trees) should be carried out in line with theconservation plan.2. Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-yieldcurves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHGemissions from the forest sectors decrease. This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbonpools (above and below-ground) but recognises the challenges of below-ground carbonmeasurement. Therefore, the specific criteria used in the fiches focuses on the measurement ofabove-ground carbon pools only.3. Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criteria 1and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10-yearintervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competentauthorities. Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over a period of 20 years forafforestation and reforestation projects and shall increase over the rotation period for restorationprojects, and be maintained or increased in the case of existing forest management andconservation forests.Progress in the forest carbon inventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to averified baseline, over the rotation period of the forest, which reflects and adapts to the industry’s levels ofmaturity, climate conditions, location features and market structures. The Taxonomy recognises thecommercial function of forests and the importance of enabling a sustainable finance market in those"

"forests. Therefore, a pragmatic view has been taken to the performance period which differs betweenforest NACE codes, as set out in Criterion 3 above. For afforestation and reforestation it is recognisedthat there will be a measurable increase in carbon stock as the forest stand develops and trees grow. Forexisting forest management, and restoration/rehabilitation the forest will include stands at varying stagesof maturity, within the context of an established forest. From a substantial mitigation perspective, the viewis taken that the maintenance of the carbon stock of the forest is important, and recognises that beyond apoint, carbon stocks may reach a saturation point in the above-ground biomass. Respecting thecommercial function of many forests, forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation.However, providing the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of net-annualincrement, the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time.In practical terms, for existing forest management and for rehabilitation/restoration of forests, the forestowner will be required to define the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level orlandscape level. In order to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate,relative to the rotation period, that carbon stocks have been maintained (against baseline) or increased(from baseline). Importantly the performance/demonstration period is linked to the rotation period, butsupported through 10-year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel, i.e. that carbon stocksare being maintained or increasing. In the event of force majeure such as the loss of a forest stand fromfire or wind-throw, the existing forest management NACE will move to the restoration NACE, andperformance will be judged on the basis of the re-establishment of the forest stand and thus carbon stockdevelopment over a period of 20-years.Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators that may benefitfrom private investment as the Taxonomy builds on EU legislation and existing national frameworks, andrecognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification andassessment that apply above the individual holding level. These include approaches adopted at thenational or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level (multiple holdings) or individual holding level.The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt tothe national context, providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for theholding level as appropriate for the investment.Do no significant harm to mitigationMitigation activities in the forest Taxonomy focus on the maintenance and increase of the forest carbonsink, whilst reducing and avoiding the GHG emissions from activities. Primary producing sectors, such asforestry are particularly vulnerable to climate-related changes and shocks (e.g. changing weatherpatterns, heatwaves, etc.). Adaptation of forests is therefore essential if the carbon sinks are to bemaintained, the stocks increased. Adaptation requirements should be framed so as to promote synergieswith substantial mitigation where possible, and as a minimum lead to no significant harm.The text of the proposed Taxonomy Regulation (Article 12(a)): For the purposes of Article 3(b), aneconomic activity shall be considered as significantly harming: (a) climate change mitigation, where thatactivity leads to significant greenhouse gas emissions;Forests are an unusual economic sector in which they provide a substantial carbon sink, and thatsignificant harm for forest climate change mitigation include where an (adaptation) activity leads to asignificant long-term reduction of the carbon sink. It is therefore important to maintain the forest area and"

thus forest carbon stocks and sink potential over the long-term. The principles for ensuring mitigationproofed adaptation activities are that adaptation responses should:
Not undermine the long-term ability of the forests to sequester carbon
"Not undermine the long-term maintenance of existing forest carbon sinks, both above and belowground"
A criterion by which the activity can be judged as Taxonomy compliant is as follows – in line with existingEU legislation:
"Adaptation responses shall comply with requirement set out in Article 29(7)b of the recast RenewableEnergy Directive (EU/2018/2001) which determines the requirement for management systems to bein place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest aremaintained, or strengthened over the long term35."
"Impact of these proposalsApproximately 430,000 enterprises are active in wood-based industries across the EU, representing 20%of EU manufacturing enterprises and 7.5% of the gross value-added of the manufacturing industry inEurope.36 The wood industry provides around 3.5 million jobs in the EU. 37 Around 60% of EU forests areprivately owned, of which 2/3 have holdings of less than 3 hectares 38, many times fragmented into smallerplots. The structure of private forest ownership is specific and considerable variations exist from countryto country, with properties sizes ranging from 0.5 hectares to more than 10,000 hectares, while theaverage size is around 13 hectares. Forest owners and managers with similar forest characteristics,under similar climate conditions and jurisdictions, are expected to be equally impacted.Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No SignificantHarm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria. This equates to 61.5%of total productive forests in the EU39, and around 20% of productive forests globally.40 Other forests/forest"
"35 Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forestare maintained, or strengthened over the long term. This is explicitly defined in Article 29(7)b which requires “…managementsystems are in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, orstrengthened over the long term.” This places the emphasis of the no significant harm requirement at a level more appropriate forthe operation of the Taxonomy and/or investment, rather than relying on national level requirements.36 In 2017. https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Wood_products_-_production_and_trade37 https://ec.europa.eu/info/events/forestry-conference-2019-apr-25_en38 UNECE Geneva Timber And Forest Study Paper 26: Private Forest Ownership in Europe39 Eurostat, 2017, and Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSCInternational, 30 April 2019.40 Data about Share Forest Certification (FSC+PEFC) in Forest Management, John Hontelez, FSC International, 30 April 2019."

"projects (i.e. non-certified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of themarket with certainty. Whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and theDNSH criteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (includingcarbon measurement and performance).Progress and performance in relation to above-ground carbon sequestration is measured relative to theverified baseline, therefore any forest owner/manager is offered the opportunity to progress in accordancewith its specific constrains and maturity level. It is unclear what proportion of the market alreadyimplements carbon sequestration measurements against a verified baseline, but examples of specificcompany progress assessments are available to demonstrate proof of concept.From a reporting perspective the Taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks. TheTaxonomy allows for performance-related information to either be reported and disclosed by the forestowner/forest management company directly, or through existing, integrated reporting mechanisms inplace at the level of the jurisdiction (whether this is at the sourcing area level (multiple holdings)), regionalor national level. The Taxonomy recognises the importance of landscape scale approaches i.e. multipleforest stands, in how the forest carbon inventory and evolution of the forest sink increment is managedand the economic lifetime of forest operations, within which the carbon stock may rise and fall within anoverall upward trajectory. The current best-performers are expected to be able to comply with theTaxonomy criteria through their existing reporting and management requirements. It is also recognisedthat some will need more time and thus the Taxonomy provides an incentive to improve performancewithin the global forest sector."
"Next steps (recommendations to the Platform)The following issues have not been addressed in this version of the forest Taxonomy criteria. However,they may provide additional mitigation opportunities for the sector and therefore merit consideration bythe Platform on Sustainable Finance:"
"The forest Taxonomy sets out criteria and thresholds for forest management activities that apply up tothe forest gate irrespective of the end-use of the forest products. This is for the pragmatic reason thatmany forest managers and owners do not know in which supply chains their products will arise. Inprinciple however, the Taxonomy recognises the holistic mitigation potential of forests and woodbeyond the forest gate both through the effect of substitution (replacing more GHG intensivematerials) and through the long-term carbon sink potential of wood products. Furthermore, the forestTaxonomy deals with the production and supply of forest biomass, but not the demand or end use ofthat biomass. The relationship between the end use of biomass and its production, i.e. market pull, isan important component of the overall sustainable finance Taxonomy to consider when incentivisingdifferent NACE sectors towards substantial contribution to mitigation. At present climate benefitsbeyond the forest gate are expected to be captured through the construction/building, energy andmanufacturing sector Taxonomies, and thus create an incentive for the use of wood in the economy,and thus the management of forests in compliance with the Taxonomy. The Platform should thereforeimprove the holistic consideration of forests’ (and forest products) mitigation potential across theirentire value chains, and across all sectors of the economy, including end of life. The followingrecommendations are made in the context of other NACE sectors:"

The buildings Taxonomy should consider the following:▪
"The development of reliable thresholds for carbon emission embodied inbuildings and construction activities utilising wood. These thresholds should bebased on a wide and consistent set of data able to benchmark best practiceacross different building uses and typologies (i.e. houses, flats, offices, etc.). Inparallel, the methodology to be used to assess embodied emissions should bedefined in detail on the basis of widely-accepted LCA and CEN/TC350standards, with particular care to ensure that the beneficial impact of carbonsequestration in timber products sourced from sustainably-managed forests isadequately recognised. This should include the end of life of wood andconstruction timber."
▪
"Making a subjective view that wood is a prime raw material with climatemitigation benefits, and should be considered with priority for construction (as acriteria for substantial contribution to mitigation). This would aid in incentivisingthe use of wood within the economy and for the long-term sequestration ofcarbon in timber products. In the current proposals,"
▪
"DNSH for construction using timber is addressed through a requirement for FSCand PECF certification. This is helpful in the short-term, but in the longer-term theplatform should consider ensuring that wood used in construction comes fromTaxonomy compliant forests."
"The manufacturing Taxonomy should systematically consider the substitution potential ofwood as a manufacturing material. Progress has been made in this regard under currentNACE 4.7 (Manufacture of other organic base chemicals). This approach is welcomedand should be expanded across other manufacturing NACE sectors. Specifically, it issuggested that the manufacturing Taxonomy includes NACE C16 (Manufacture of woodand of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw andplaiting materials) and C31 (Manufacture of furniture) and develop robust and verifiablesubstitution criteria (to ensure substantial mitigation) and DNSH criteria (see aboveproposal for buildings)."
"When considering the development of Circular Economy principles into the Taxonomy, both as DNSHand as substantial contribution, the Platform should give specific consideration to the use of forestproducts throughout different economic sectors."
"The current proposal does not capture or address all possible sources of emissions taking place inthe forest during the lifetime of a forest project or activity. For example, the Taxonomy does notaccount for fuel use by machinery within the forest sector (which is currently accounted for in theenergy and transport sectors)."
"The Platform should further explore broadening the current criteria to account for individualimprovements, measures, to be eligible as individual investments towards meeting the overall forestactivity criteria, i.e. the substantial mitigation objective."
- 49 -
"GHG measurement is required for above-ground carbon sequestration on the basis that belowground carbon is technically more challenging to assess and measure overtime. Instead, belowground carbon shall be maintained and/or increased through a proxy, i.e. the application ofmanagement practices, reflected through cumulative Sustainable Forest Management and Do NoSignificant Harm requirements. The Platform is advised to further explore below-ground carbonmeasurements and review existing impact assessment methodologies that might complement thecurrent threshold for below-ground carbon measurements. It is further suggested that the Platformconsider the approach to soil-carbon in the agriculture Taxonomy and whether there should bealignment also for the forest Taxonomy."
"It is the view of the TEG that these criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliance with thecriteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verificationapproaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularlyaudited. It is recommended that the Platform further develops guidance, including a more granularmapping of the Taxonomy criteria and thresholds, with existing internationally recognised andapplicable forest certification schemes. This would provide support to investors and forestmanagement companies and individuals when seeking compliance with the Taxonomy."
"In the context of interlinkages between Taxonomy sectors, the impact of deforestation is often a resultof other-sector activities (such as agriculture or building development) rather than forestry. ThePlatform are invited to consider whether deforestation is sufficiently addressed in other Taxonomysectors, in order to support substantial contribution in the forest sector and as a DNSH to mitigation inthe forest sector as enabled through other Taxonomy sectors."
"The Platform should further explore potential end-user issues and opportunities for investors andfinancial institutions, including potential challenges that may arise in relation to associating capitalexpenditures or revenues that can be tagged or screened through the current criteria set for forestmanagement/land use activities. For example, an investor may invest in a wood processing facility,which itself is not covered by the current forest Taxonomy sectors, but the operation of the facility willinteract with the management of forests and the use of forest products. Clarity should be provided toinvestors on where and at what point in the value/supply chain they are expected to considercompliance with the Taxonomy – specifically for sectors upstream or downstream of the specificinvestment.o"
"The Platform is invited to consider and develop further the performance period for theexisting forest management NACE. With the proposed Taxonomy for existing forestmanagement, a pragmatic view has been taken to align performance with the commercialrotation period of a forest – i.e. allowing for changes in carbon stock within a forest andproviding flexibility given that different forests will be harvested at different periods. Thisimplicitly recognises that the forest will remain forest and when managed under SFM,continue to sequester carbon. Importantly this means that the forest may be harvested ata commercial point determined by wood quality and quantity and not at a point where theforest has reached a carbon stock saturation point – which may be considerably longer.The Platform is therefore asked to consider if it is sufficient to have additionality providedthrough SFM and DNSH, but that for existing forest management substantial contributioncan be judged as the maintenance of the forest carbon stock rather than its increase.Whilst the focus of this Taxonomy is on greening of activities, it may be relevant toconsider the end use of the forest biomass when reflecting on this point – in that around"

"Alignment with existing legislationIn order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consideralignment with existing EU legislative instruments and established agreements. The proposed criteriaand DNSH requirements align with existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important torecognise where legislation provides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and wherelegislation allows for more substantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of therecast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach to minimise the riskof using forest biomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national orsub-national laws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring tothe Paris agreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place atforest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, orstrengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposedin the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article29 does not require an explicit ‘substantial contribution’ to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, thecompliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based,however through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws ormanagement systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed. The Taxonomy seeks toestablish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation canbe assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding.Do no significant harm assessmentKey environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows:"
ability of forests to adapt to a changing climate;
impact on water resources as well as on water quality;
"pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertilizer;"
impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of highecological value to forests and illegal logging.

Recognising the differentconditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and canbe demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same outcome.SFM requirements include a no-conversion land requirement to preserve high carbon stockland areas that is consistent with the RED II, which defines 2008 as a base year for land usechange. This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g.ISCC and RSPO RED).Harvesting activities must be carried out in compliance with national laws in the country oforigin, shall comply with EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and the EU Forest LawEnforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), where applicable.Regeneration of forests after harvesting is covered under EU legislation and has been includedas a requirement to ensure regeneration is taken into consideration for forest activities outsidethe EU.SFM requirements should be considered in combination with the Do No Significant Harmcriteria.They can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemesthat are regularly audited."

Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-yieldcurves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHGemissions from the forest sectors decrease.

"The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbonstocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly contextspecific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms ofmaintaining and/or increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of forestcarbon stocks.Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species andnumber of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation). Using the growth-yield curves,information will be given on the annual increment in m3/year/ha, which can be used for thebasis of the GHG balance. The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines), itrecommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representingapproximately 0,5 ton of carbon. Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbondioxide."
"3. Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect tocriterion 1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at10-year intervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/orcompetent authorities. Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over therotation period of the forest for restoration projects.• In order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential, it is essential the Taxonomyaccounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices, and thedemonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living, abovegroundbiomass, specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects.• SFM requirements are essential to guarantee the maintenance in carbon sequestration frombelow-ground biomass, dead organic matter or soils: increase in carbon sequestration frombelow ground carbon pools is not included due to the high uncertainty in measuring it.• Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall bedemonstrated relative to the rotation period of the forest. Progress in the forest carboninventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to a verified baseline, overthe rotation period of the forest, which reflects and adapts to the industry’s levels of maturity,climate conditions, location features and market structures. For restoration/rehabilitation theforest will include stands at varying stages of maturity, within the context of an establishedforest. From a substantial mitigation perspective, the view is taken that the maintenance of thecarbon stock of the forest is important, and recognises that beyond a point, carbon stocks mayreach a saturation point in the above-ground biomass. Respecting the commercial function ofmany forests, forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation. However,providing the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of net-annualincrement, the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time. Inpractical terms, for rehabilitation/restoration of forests, the forest owner will be required todefine the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level or landscape level. Inorder to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate, relative to therotation period, that carbon stocks have been maintained (against baseline) or increased (frombaseline). Importantly the performance/demonstration period is linked to the rotation period, butsupported through 10-year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel, i.e. that carbonstocks are being maintained or increasing. In the event of force majeure such as the loss of aforest stand from fire or wind-throw, the existing forest management NACE will move to the"

"restoration NACE, and performance will be judged on the basis of the re-establishment of theforest stand and thus carbon stock development over a period of 20-years.Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators thatmay benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and nationalframeworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existingapproaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. Theseinclude approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level(multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reportingframework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that thecompliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate forthe investment."
"International relevance of the forest TaxonomyIt is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliancewith the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verificationapproaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularlyaudited. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do NoSignificant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria thatvaries across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests inthe EU65, and around 20% of productive forests globally. 66 Other forests/forest projects (i.e. noncertified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market withcertainty. Note: whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the DNSHcriteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (includingcarbon measurement and performance)."
"Alignment with existing legislationIn order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consideralignment with existing EU legislative instruments. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements alignwith existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where legislationprovides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objectives and where legislation allows for moresubstantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets outsustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach to minimise the risk of using forestbiomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-nationallaws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Parisagreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forestsourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, orstrengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposedin the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article"

"29 does not require an explicit ‘substantial contribution’ to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, thecompliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based,however through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws ormanagement systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed. The Taxonomy seeks toestablish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation canbe assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding.Do no significant harm assessmentKey environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows:"

Itimplies no change of land use, includes planting/seeding oftemporarily un-stocked forest areas as well as planting/seedingof areas with forest cover. It includes coppice from trees thatwere originally planted or seeded69. The FAO FRA definition ofreforestation excludes natural regeneration.

EUforests already account for more than 20% of the global forest carbon sink, and yet an increase in carbonsequestration from forests is essential to the achievement of a net-zero target by 2050 in Europe andglobally.77Forests can deliver substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation through sequestration ofcarbon during tree growth and in the accumulation of biomass in soils, vegetation, leaf litter and deadwood (up to forest gate).Reforestation activities can deliver substantial mitigation through:"

The Taxonomy acknowledges a definitional change from ‘afforestation’ and ‘reforestation’ to ‘existingforest management’ according to the LULUCF Regulations 20-year accounting rule as per Art. 5(3).
"73 20 years aligns with the measurement of carbon and under LULUCF regulation land that was afforested moves from category“afforestation” to “forest land” after 20 years74 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal may be to perform at a scale above the single foreststand. Absence of landscape management access will in turn require disclosure at the single forest stand. The Forest Taxonomyleaves to forest owners and companies to explain, document on which level they report.75 This threshold should apply considering the following force majeure clause: underperformance resulting from natural disturbancecan be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not result in non-compliance with the Taxonomycriteria.76 http://www.fao.org/state-of-forests/en/.77 European Forest Institute."

All threecriteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are:"
"1. Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements inorder to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems andforest services. SFM is defined as ‘the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in away, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitalityand their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and socialfunctions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to otherecosystems’.78 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibilityfor the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified),and apply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemesthat are regularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors, forestowners, buyers of timber and/or residues and forest management companies to verifycompliance with the criteria in Europe and globally. 79"
"SFM requirements use EU legislation as minimum baseline and build on the REDII, andexisting industry best practice criteria e.g. Climate Bonds Initiative’s Forestry criteria, the ForestEurope general guidelines for sustainable forest management."
"To help with application of the criteria, the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 anon-exhaustive list of activities that would, if implemented effectively, lead to the achievementof the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks, andconservation of non-productive functions. The aim of the list is to provide support to operatorsand investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented. Recognising the differentconditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and canbe demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same outcome.SFM requirements include a no-conversion land requirement to preserve high carbon stockland areas that is consistent with the RED II, which defines 2008 as a base year for land usechange. This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g.ISCC and RSPO RED)."

"third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (as described inCriteria 3)89.RationaleA substantial portion of forestry activities will fall under the bracket of existing forest management. It istherefore proposed that existing forest management is recognized in the Taxonomy, provided it candemonstrate maintenance of high carbon stocks in multiple pools and overall improvement in the forestcarbon sink.Forests cover around 30% of the global landmass (In Europe this figure is higher at ~40-45%) and absorbroughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year. 90 Forests regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity,play an integral part in the carbon cycle, support livelihoods and can help drive sustainable growth. EUforests already account for more than 20% of the global forest carbon sink, and yet an increase in carbonsequestration from forests is essential to the achievement of a net-zero target by 2050 in Europe andglobally.91Forests can deliver substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation through sequestration ofcarbon during tree growth and in the accumulation of biomass in soils, vegetation, leaf litter and deadwood (up to forest gate).The sustainable management of forests can deliver substantial mitigation through:"
An increase or maintenance in the forest capacity to sequester carbon from above ground andbelow ground carbon pools;

"mitigation; and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative (increasing) and permanent. All threecriteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation. Specifically, they are:"
"1. Criterion 1: Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) requirements inorder to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems andforest services. SFM is defined as ‘the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in away, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitalityand their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and socialfunctions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to otherecosystems’.92 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory, but allow flexibilityfor the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate (providing that they are justified),and apply internationally (provided they can be verified via independent third-party schemesthat are regularly audited), or under international agreements. This will allow investors, forestowners, buyers of timber and/or residues and forest management companies to verifycompliance with the criteria in Europe and globally. 93"
"SFM requirements use EU legislation as minimum baseline and build on the REDII, andexisting industry best practice criteria e.g. Climate Bonds Initiative’s Forestry criteria, the ForestEurope general guidelines for sustainable forest management."
"To help with application of the criteria, the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 anon-exhaustive list of activities that would, if implemented effectively, lead to the achievementof the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks, andconservation of non-productive functions. The aim of the list is to provide support to operatorsand investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented. Recognising the differentconditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and canbe demonstrated ex-ante as leading to the same outcome.SFM requirements include a no-conversion land requirement to preserve high carbon stockland areas that is consistent with the RED II, which defines 2008 as a base year for land usechange. This base year has also been adopted by several global certification schemes (e.g.ISCC and RSPO RED).Harvesting activities must be carried out in compliance with national laws in the country oforigin, shall comply with EU Timber Regulation (EU/995/2010) and the EU Forest LawEnforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT), where applicable.Regeneration of forests after harvesting is covered under EU legislation and has been includedas a requirement to ensure regeneration is taken into consideration for forest activities outsidethe EU.SFM requirements should be considered in combination with the Do No Significant Harmcriteria.They can be informed by applying forest certification using independent third-party schemesthat are regularly audited."

"2. Criterion 2: The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline, based on growth-yieldcurves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHGemissions from the forest sectors decrease.

However, it recognises the challenges of below-ground carbon measurement.Therefore, the specific criteria used in the tables focuses on the measurement of above-groundcarbon pools only.• The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbonstocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly contextspecific. The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms ofmaintaining and/or increasing carbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of forestcarbon stocks.• Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species andnumber of trees (in case of afforestation and reforestation).

"3. Criterion 3: The demonstration of permanence and steady progress with respect to criteria1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan (or equivalent instruments) at 10-yearintervals, to be subsequently reviewed by an independent third-party certifier and/or competentauthorities. A description of state of play is required every 10 years to ensure steady andoverall progress is aimed for and achieved. That aligns with management cycles time horizonsperformed in the EU as well as National Forest Inventories, performed on a 10-year basis."
"In order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential, it is essential the Taxonomyaccounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices, and thedemonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living, abovegroundbiomass, specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects.SFM requirements are essential to guarantee the maintenance in carbon sequestration frombelow-ground biomass, dead organic matter or soils: increase in carbon sequestration frombelow ground carbon pools is not included due to the high uncertainty in measuring it.Sequestration levels shall be reported at a minimum every 10 years, and performance shall bedemonstrated relative to the rotation period of the forest. Progress in the forest carboninventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to a verified baseline, overthe rotation period of the forest, which reflects and adapts to the industry’s levels of maturity,climate conditions, location features and market structures. For restoration/rehabilitation theforest will include stands at varying stages of maturity, within the context of an establishedforest. From a substantial mitigation perspective, the view is taken that the maintenance of the"

"carbon stock of the forest is important, and recognises that beyond a point, carbon stocks mayreach a saturation point in the above-ground biomass. Respecting the commercial function ofmany forests, forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation. However,providing the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of net-annualincrement, the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time. Inpractical terms, for rehabilitation/restoration of forests, the forest owner will be required todefine the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level or landscape level. Inorder to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate, relative to therotation period, that carbon stocks have been maintained (against baseline) or increased (frombaseline). Importantly the performance/demonstration period is linked to the rotation period, butsupported through 10-year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel, i.e. that carbonstocks are being maintained or increasing. In the event of force majeure such as the loss of aforest stand from fire or wind-throw, the existing forest management NACE will move to therestoration NACE, and performance will be judged on the basis of the re-establishment of theforest stand and thus carbon stock development over a period of 20-years.Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to small-scale operators thatmay benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and nationalframeworks, and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existingapproaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level. Theseinclude approaches adopted at the national or sub-national/regional level, sourcing-area level(multiple holdings) or individual holding level. The Taxonomy does not specify which reportingframework is used, and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context, providing that thecompliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate forthe investment.Harvesting practices, such as thinning, removals, final fellings, etc. will temporarily reduce thecarbon stock and the potential to sequester carbon. However, such forest managementactivities should be eligible under Taxonomy, as long as SFM practices are in place; and thatcarbon sinks of above and below ground carbon are maintained or increased, over the rotationperiod of the forest; or where selective removal of trees is required as part of the forestconservation plan. The rotation period is here defined as the time from seeding, planting ornatural regeneration through to the point of harvest."
"International relevance of the forest TaxonomyIt is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally, provided compliancewith the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verificationapproaches, such as forest certification using independent third-party schemes that are regularlyaudited. Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do NoSignificant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy, with the exception of the Conversion criteria thatvaries across jurisdictions and forestry activities. This equates to 61.5% of total productive forests inthe EU94, and around 20% of productive forests globally. 95 Other forests/forest projects (i.e. non-"

"certified) may also meet the criteria, but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market withcertainty. Note: whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 (ex Conversion criteria) and the DNSHcriteria, verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required (includingcarbon measurement and performance)."
"Alignment with existing legislationIn order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy, it is appropriate to consideralignment with existing EU legislative instruments. The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements alignwith existing EU legislation in the context of forestry. It is important to recognise where legislationprovides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and where legislation allows for moresubstantial contribution to those objectives. For example, Article 29 of the recast RED, sets outsustainability criteria for forests using a risk-based approach to minimise the risk of using forestbiomass derived from unsustainable production, relaying in Article 29(6) on national or sub-nationallaws or if such evidence is not available on supply level, and in Article 29(7) referring to the Parisagreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forestsourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, orstrengthened over the long term. These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposedin the Taxonomy, and some of the DNSH criteria. Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article29 does not require an explicit ‘substantial contribution’ to GHG mitigation. Furthermore, thecompliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved, is risk-based,however through a verification process. A risk-based approach assumes that if national laws ormanagement systems are in place, that the RED criteria are addressed. The Taxonomy seeks toestablish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation canbe assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding.Do no significant harm assessmentKey environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows:"
ability of forests to adapt to a changing climate;
impact on water resources as well as on water quality;
"pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertilizer;"
impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of highecological value to forests and illegal logging.
The DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forestmitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1). The criteria can be informed by applying forest certification usingindependent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Compliance shall be reported through aforest management plan (or equivalent) as per criterion 3 of the forest mitigation Taxonomy.(2) Adaptation

Mitigation criteriaPrinciple
Conservation forests shall maintain or increase carbon sinks of above andbelow ground carbon.All the Criteria are additive and shall apply together:
"Criterion 1: Mandatory application of the following Sustainable ForestManagement (SFM) requirements:o Develop and implement a forest conservation plan thatidentifies the conservation objectives of the site and thenecessary conservation measures. These shall includepractices that maintain or increase existing carbon stocks,considering the non-exhaustive list of examples practicesunder Category C in Annex F2. These should allow forapplication of other similar approaches, that recognise localspecificities and conditions, while maintaining or improving soilquality, and biodiversity in line with conservation objectives;o Do not convert high carbon stock land (i.e. primary forest,peatlands, wetlands, and grasslands) which has this status inor after January 2008;o Harvesting carried out in line with the conservation plan shouldbe undertaken in compliance with the laws in the country oforigin99;o Any harvested forest should be regenerated after harvestingand in line with the forest conservation plan.Criterion 2: Establish a verified baseline GHG balance of relevantcarbon pools at the beginning of the investment;"

"Criterion 3: Demonstrate continued maintenance and increase ofcarbon sinks from above-ground carbon over time, supported by anddisclosed through a forest conservation plan (or equivalent) at 10-yearintervals, that shall be reviewed by an independent third-party certifierand/or competent authorities."
Continued compliance with the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM)requirements is demonstrated and continuously disclosed at 10 -yearintervals through a forest conservation plan that shall be reviewed byan independent third-party certifier and/or competent authorities (asdescribed in Criteria 3). The primary management objective of theforest should continue to be conservation – otherwise the forest will besubject to different NACE metrics and thresholds.

Calculating the GHG balance baselinerequires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees.Using the growth-yield curves, information will be given on the annualincrement in m3/year/ha, which can be used for the basis of the GHGbalance.

Above ground Carbon stocks shall be maintained or increased abovecarbon baseline over time.

"100 Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area, the species and number of trees (in case of planting).The increment based on the growth-yield curves gives the approximate number of how many m3/year/ha is available for increment.The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, itrecommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered; 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 0,5 ton of carbon.Further one ton of carbon equals 44/12 = 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide101 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal may be to perform at a scale above the single foreststand. Absence of landscape management access will in turn require disclosure at the single forest stand. The Forest Taxonomyleaves to forest owners and companies to explain, document on which level they report.102 This threshold should apply considering the following force majeure clause: underperformance resulting from naturaldisturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not result in non-compliance with theTaxonomy criteria."

"Given the objectives of the Taxonomy, conservation finance should be enabled within the forest sectorand conservation forest – which may have no productive value – recognised for their carbon sink role.It is therefore proposed that conservation forests are recognised in the Taxonomy, provided they candemonstrate maintenance of high carbon stocks in multiple pools and overall improvement in the forestcarbon sink."

The Taxonomy seeks toestablish specific and measurable criteria, metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation canbe assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding.Do no significant harm assessmentKey environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows:"
ability of forests to adapt to a changing climate;

"Forestry annexesANNEX F1 Initial analysis and proposal to the Platform for the operation of the forest Taxonomyfrom an ‘enabling’ perspectiveThe following text is a proposal for identifying what enabling activities for the Forest NACE sectors wouldlook like and identifies questions regarding the operation of such a proposal in the context of theTaxonomy. Enabling activities are defined in the Taxonomy Political Agreement Article 11(a) of December2019 as “…An economic activity shall be considered to contribute substantially to one or more of theenvironmental objectives set out in Article 5 by directly enabling other activities to make a substantialcontribution to one or more of those objectives, and where that activity:(a) does not lead to a lock-in in assets that undermine long-term environmental goals, considering theeconomic lifetime of those assets; (b) has a substantial positive environmental impact on the basis oflifecycle considerations.”In simple terms, the current forest taxonomyrecognises activities that provide substantialmitigation up to the forest gate. Anenablingapproach would recognise where forestbased products from the forest sector aresupporting substantial mitigation beyond theforest gate, i.e. in other sectors of the economy."
Figure 6 provides a simplified schematic of thisrelationship.
Figure 6: Schematic of greening of & by i.e. enabling in the Forestry Taxonomy
Rationale for forestry as an enabling activity
"Forestry provides a range of services to society, such as material, non-material (barriers), renewableenergy and environmental services – the bioeconomy"
"The replacement of GHG intensive materials and energy in the wider economy relies on other sectorsto provide fibre for substitution, which implicates demand and response from the forest sector, whichcurrently has only limited recognition in current accounting frameworks (e.g. LULUCF Regulation)."
Further recognising the role of forest-based products in the wider process of transitioning to the greeneconomy could incentivise the sector in a positive way – generating demand for Taxonomy compliantforestry – and thus deliver cross sector incentives for substantial contribution to mitigation.
- 93 -
"Exploring the way to introduce an enabling approach could also help ensure that private sectorfinancing of the use of forest-based products is driving towards the use of more sustainable productsand production and, importantly, more sustainable end uses."
"Key challengesValorisation of the forest-based products contribution in the down-stream sector. The principles ofthe circular economy look towards the designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materialsin use, and regenerating natural systems. Therefore, forest-based products that have already been usedwithin an economic sector other than forestry should become part of the circular economy and contributein another sector – with the aim to keep the wood in its material form for as long as possible beforedisposal and/or energy recovery. This follows the principle of resource efficiency (EU Forest Strategydescribed it as: using forest resources in a way that minimises the impact on the environment andclimate, and prioritising the forest outputs that have higher added-value, create more jobs and contributeto a better carbon balance). This raises a key question as to the point at which the forest-based sectorwould be recognised for the initial material production (as a means of substantial contribution), and tocontribute to substitution in multiple sectors (where the same wood is used) for their decarbonisation."
"Different Forest NACE. The current proposal for a Forest Taxonomy includes five NACE sectordistinctions, Afforestation, Reforestation, Rehabilitation/restoration, Existing Forest Management andConservation Forests. Would it be necessary to establish a link between the use of wood products inanother economy NACE and a specific forest sector NACE? If so, which one as all form part of the forestmanagement system? How would this be done, and what if a product is used in multiple NACE categories(how to count the multiple substitution)."
"Trans NACE reporting, traceability and compliance. The use of forest-based products in one sector ofthe economy may be supported through a separate investor (say for building regeneration) who is notinvesting in the forest sector. The forest sector producers, especially the owners mostly do not alwaysknow the end-use of the wood products passing beyond the forest gate. However, there would need to bein place some form of traceability and chain of custody to ensure compliance, for example exploring howinformation from the HWP category in the LULUCF Regulation could be used."
"Enabling and supply. Do enabling activities by default need to arise from a sector/supply that istaxonomy eligible/compliant in the context of significant contribution? For example, if wood used inconstruction of a building is recognised as “enabling”, the source of the wood would need to be taxonomyaligned within the forest sector."
- 94 -
"GHG emissions. Regarding enabling activities within the manufacturing sector, no criteria on the GHGemissions from manufacturing are given because the benefits these lead to are considered to outweightheir emissions. For Forestry, this would be consistent with the current IPCC Guidelines (Emissions areattributed at the point of harvest and thus in the forest sector). However, the large-scale adoption of woodenergy or wood material use could lead to an increased drain on the existing forest carbon sink – andmay thus warrant safeguards."
"Multiple enablers. The end use of wood is highly varied, with both different fractions of the wood used indifferent resource streams, and different products or end uses generated at different stages (Figure 7).How and at what point in the wood flow would “greening by” be defined, or it should be counted at eachpoint when it substitutes non-renewable resources?"
Figure 7: Sankey diagram of main wood flows in the EU. Blanke & Mantau 2016
"Opportunities from existing practiceDespite the potential challenges to the Taxonomy for including a more holistic approach to the use ofwood products in the wider economy, there are a number of cases where operators have been able todevelop approaches to tracking or estimating the substation effects and benefits of forest products in thewider economy. These demonstrate proof of concept for a wider applicability of the forest Taxonomy thanfocussing only on the management of forests up to the forest gate."
"The TEG has received various documents in this regard, including information provided by Stora Ensoand SCA (a Swedish publicly listed forest products company) – both demonstrate the added value (inclimate terms) of forest products in the overall economy through substitution effects. The point ofcontention within the forest sector is that the EU’s accounting of the climate benefits from forestry are not"
- 95 -
"fully attributed in the EU’s GHG accounts to forestry as a sector. i.e. the substitution effects are notattributed to the sector, only the emissions of logging. They do however point out that in the UNFCCCaccounts, all the benefits are recognised, but that substation would be recognised in a separate sectorthan forestry. They go on in the report to demonstrate a feasible calculation approach for substitutionbenefits that could be applied by businesses that are collecting the necessary information. Someelements of this approach would need to be further validated, such as the specific calculation of thesubstitution effect itself – as this is based on a conversion factor for three product groups. These may beaccurate, conservative or inaccurate – but what is clear is that they are not a direct measurement, but anassumed substitution level. This may be ok, but worth recognising."
"Overall therefore it would seem possible for the forest industry or specific businesses to be able tocalculate the substitution effect of forest products arising in the forest sector (as defined in the Taxonomy)but delivering substitution benefits in other economy sectors. The question still remains to which NACEsector the benefits arising from the use of wood should be attributed? The logic of the taxonomy overallsuggests that this should still be in the sector that takes the raw material and processes it into somethingwhich will deliver substitution, or utilises that material (or energy) in substitute for another. It would seeminappropriate to recognise the felling of trees, i.e. the provision of the raw material as an enabling activityper se. It is recognised, however, that forest-products arise from a renewable resource, rather than thefinite resources of the extractive industries."
"Ideas on a possible enabling approachWithin the manufacturing TEG, the Taxonomy already recognises enabling activities. These arerecognised on the basis of the principal of “The manufacture of low carbon technologies that result insubstantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy (including private households) iseligible.” It is therefore the production of something that would lead to substantial GHG emissionreductions in other sectors. In this context, components of renewable energy infrastructure are cited,amongst others. The line between the manufacture of an essential product for decarbonisation andsubstantial mitigation, is clear. Forest products are slightly different. Wood materials and energy are notnecessarily essential components of low-carbon technology, in that a house or furniture is not necessarilylow-carbon if it is made from wood. The key identifying feature for wood products is one of substitution,whether another low(er)-carbon product could be used or whether there are other forms of energy (ordemand reduction) that would be more carbon beneficial. Therefore, the logical link for ‘greening by’ ofthe forest sector would need to be able to demonstrate something like the following criteria:"
The product that has been substituted was essential to the low-carbon performance of the sector inwhich it is used
The product that has been substituted was of a higher GHG/carbon intensity than the substitutewoody biomass (Thresholds could be proposed]
"That primary manufacturing was necessary and could not have been substituted from the recoveryand re-use or recycling of existing products, including wood-based products."
- 96 -
"That alternative forms of renewable energy, such as Solar PV or Wind could not have been utilisedinstead / or have been subverted through the use of woody biomass."
"In light of the design of the overall Taxonomy (activity based) and the fact that the substitution effect canonly be judged in an end-use sector (i.e. at the product level) it is challenging to produce a ‘greening by’approach that can be implemented through the forest Taxonomy alone. As such, it is proposed that the‘greening of’ through the use of forest products, is addressed through those sectors that utilise thoseforest products (i.e. end use or intermediary sectors), such as manufacturing or buildings. Specificrecommendations to other Taxonomy sectors (Buildings and Manufacturing) are made in the preamble tothe forest Taxonomy, and not repeated here. These can be summarised as follows:"
The development of reliable thresholds for carbon emission embodied in activities utilising wood. Thisshould include the end of life of wood and construction timber.
"The development of robust and verifiable substitution criteria to determine when wood use makes asubstantial contribution to mitigation, and when not."
"Sectors using long-lived wood products should make a subjective view that wood is a prime rawmaterial with climate mitigation benefits, and should be considered with priority for use in theeconomy. This must be accompanied by robust DNSH criteria to ensure that the demand for forestproducts does not lead to impacts on the forest resources. The future Taxonomy should ensure thatwood used in other sectors to deliver substantial contribution to mitigation, is also compliant with theforest Taxonomy."
"When considering the development of Circular Economy principles into the Taxonomy, both as DNSHand as substantial contribution, specific consideration should be made to the use of forest productsthroughout different economic sectors."

AGRICULTURE
"Why agriculture is addressed in the TaxonomyAgriculture is the management of the natural environment, plants and animals to produce and processfood, feed, fibre, fuel and other products. As a sector, it plays a central role in climate change, sustainabledevelopment and food security. It is projected that by 2050 the global population will increase to 10 billion,resulting in a 50% increase in the demand for food. However, even at present, the food supply chaincontributes 19-29% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the majority of which, for most supplychains, occurs at the farm level (80-90%). In the EU, 10% of GHG emissions are attributed toagriculture.124 This alone presents opportunities for significant climate change mitigation. However,agriculture differs from other sectors when considering climate change mitigation as it can act as both asource and a sink for GHG emissions. Soil carbon and biomass (trees, shrubs and grasslands) are alsorelevant as major pools of carbon. For this reason, agriculture has the potential to be a net positive sectorfrom an emissions perspective. At the same time, agricultural productivity is simultaneously vulnerable toclimate change (including, but not limited to, heat stress, drought, flooding, changes in seasonality andextreme weather events) and central to supporting adaptation and resilience through its provision ofecosystem services and income for billions of households worldwide.Subjects coveredThe following economic activities are explicitly addressed in the Taxonomy:"
"Growing of non-perennials: including cereals, rice, leguminous crops and oil seeds, vegetables,melons, roots and tubers, sugar cane and fibre crops;"
"Growing of perennials: including grapes, tropical and sub-tropical fruits, citrus fruits, stone fruits,other tree and bush fruits and nuts, oleaginous fruits, beverage crops, spices, aromatics and drugand pharmaceutical crops, grass leys;"
"Animal production: including dairy and other cattle and buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs and poultryand the management of their waste (manure) and related grassland or pasture."
"In addition, mixed farming, where combinations of the above activities are carried out on a farm holding,can be addressed via the application of the relevant thresholds and criteria from these same threeactivities. For the purpose of the Taxonomy, mixed farming involves any operation with both livestock andcrop production. Crops grown in mixed farming can be grown either to feed livestock or for separate saleas a cash crop. In assessing mixed farming operations, cropland production should be screened usingcriteria for growing of non-perennials (e.g. if vineyards or orchards are included) or perennial crops (e.g. ifa farm grows cereals). Livestock production should be assessed according to the animal productioncriteria. It is important to note that recoupling of crops and livestock can lead to greater resourceefficiency and reduced reliance on synthetic inputs, thus improving climate and environmental"

"performance125. At the same time, if accompanied by productivity improvement on existing agriculturallands, mixed farming reduces the expansion pressures of agriculture into non cultivated/used land. Therecoupling of crop and livestock production is a systemic change which is beneficial and feasible in manycontexts, but it is not a mandatory requirement of the Taxonomy.Setting criteria and thresholdsAs noted above, agriculture can act as both a source and a sink for GHG emissions. However, it may notbe possible to reach net negative emissions in every instance of agricultural activity or on every farm,particularly those that are specialised in nature and/or have low carbon stocking capacity. Therefore, theTaxonomy does not require the demonstration of net negative emissions at the activity or farm level, butinstead requires that the following three criteria must all be met for agricultural activities to be recognisedas delivering substantial contributions to mitigation:1. Reduced emissions from ongoing land and animal management.2. Increased removals of carbon from the atmosphere and storage in above- and below-groundbiomass through ongoing land and animal management, up to the limit of saturation levels.3. The agricultural activity is not being carried out on land that was previously deemed to be ‘of highcarbon stock’.The lack of deep GHG reporting datasets from which to establish best performance benchmarks, coupledwith the lack of emissions budgets or sequestration targets for the agricultural sector at either the EU orglobal level, meant it was not possible to set robust absolute GHG thresholds for either criteria 1 or 2.Furthermore, given the high degree of heterogeneity across the agricultural sector (in terms of productionsystem, crop or livestock type, farm size, environmental and biophysical conditions, etc.), it was felt to beinappropriate to do so.However, requiring a relative GHG improvement compared to an ‘own-farm counterfactual’ is workablewithin this context of high heterogeneity. For criteria 1, emissions reductions targets as a percentage ofthat counterfactual have been established using studies of the emissions reductions needed across theagricultural sector as whole over time. For criteria 2, recognising that carbon stocking potential is highlyvariable across different land parcels, but that carbon sequestration represents a large mitigation potentialavailable to the agriculture sector, a simpler requirement has been set – simply that carbon stocks areincreased over a 20-year period – which recognises that preventing ongoing carbon losses andincreasing sequestration is viable to make a substantial contribution in this case. It is noted, however, thatthe studies on emissions reduction paths are limited in number and therefore the criteria would benefitfrom greater clarity on the precise transition needed in the agriculture sector to contribute to a net-zeroeconomy in 2050.In addition, recognising that relative GHG improvement targets are a fairly blunt instrument and requirefarm level GHG accounting, which is not yet widespread, an additional, alternative approach is proposed.Namely, demonstration of the deployment of a specified bundle of land and, if appropriate, animalmanagement practices across the production area. From a review of the scientific literature, thesepractices have been selected because they deliver substantial mitigation with relatively high certainty"

"across a range of biophysical and farming conditions. They should therefore be widely applicable andprovide a more directly communicable approach to farmers, although this would benefit from testing withkey stakeholders globally, including small- and large-scale farmers. It will, of course, be necessary toregularly review this list of practices to integrate new advances in scientific knowledge.To maximise usability, it is left open to the user whether they demonstrate i) emissions reductions andincreased sequestration directly or, alternatively, ii) the deployment of the specified bundle of practicesthat have been deemed to represent a substantial contribution to mitigation. Whichever approach istaken, three yearly audits are required to demonstrate ongoing compliance with the criteria andthresholds. This is to address the multi-year timeframes over which emissions reductions and carbonstocking can occur and acknowledges the risks to the permanence of carbon stocks. The establishmentof a pool of proxy indicators for compliance with these Criteria (such as vetted and approved existingstandards, certification schemes, carbon credit schemes and similar) would greatly facilitate uptake ofand disclosure against the Criteria.Recognising the potential for agricultural production to enable substantial mitigation in othersectorsIt is noted that besides supplying food and feed, agriculture has the potential to (and increasingly does)supply biomass to be used as raw materials for the bioeconomy including textiles, biobased materials forindustry, construction and packaging, and bioenergy. Biomaterials can have longer life-cycles than foodand feed products, and therefore can contribute to longer-term removal and sequestration of carbon.Bioenergy can displace emissions from burning fossil fuels. Agricultural production can therefore enablemitigation through other economic activities.The criteria presented here focus on the substantial mitigation that can be realised in the way these cropsand resources are produced, regardless of their end use. They do not take into account any contributionthat agricultural products can make to mitigation via the bioeconomy. The Platform is asked to considerthis aspect further to determine whether and under what circumstances these or alternative criteria for(some) agricultural production or producers might be appropriate in light of potential substantialcontributions they can enable in downstream economic activities that are part of the bioeconomy.Aligning with regulationsFor clarification, the recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) includes a number of sustainabilityrequirements relating to the production of the feedstock used to produce bioenergy, and these agriculturalcriteria are consistent with those requirements which can be applied across agricultural producers fortheir production of food, bioenergy and biomaterials for various supply chains.These criteria also take guidance from, and look to build on, the cross compliance measures of theCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP), and in particular the current proposals for the post-2020 CAP perAnnex III of COM(2018)392126."

"As a general principle, the working group has aimed to ensure that the ‘do no significant harm’ criteria inparticular are aligned with the conditionality requirements, that is, the criteria that farmers must meet tobecome eligible for CAP subsidies. The ‘substantial contribution’ criteria go beyond these requirementsas this was felt to be necessary to meet the scale of impact required to count as a substantialcontribution. The working group focussed on the post-2020 CAP rather than the current CAP to ‘futureproof’ as much as possible these criteria. Efforts have been made to cross reference these criteria to thepost-2020 CAP but the working group is cognisant that the post-2020 CAP has not been adopted at thistime, and the Commission and, subsequently the Platform on Sustainable Finance (“the Platform”), isrequested to review the provisions of the post 2020 CAP when finalised and consider whether anychanges would need to be made to these Criteria based on that.Addressing synergies and potential co-benefits in agricultural productionThe interrelated nature of land management decisions and the impact on soil, water, biodiversity andcarbon cycles means that the management of agricultural land for one objective of the Taxonomy (e.g.climate mitigation) will have an impact on other objectives of the Taxonomy (e.g. protection of healthyecosystems). The Taxonomy is set up to ensure that, for economic activities that are compliant with theTaxonomy, a substantial contribution to mitigation in the agriculture sector, does not come at the expenseof significant harm to the other five environmental objectives. However, the interrelated nature of theseenvironmental goals actually offers the opportunity to develop substantial mitigation approaches that notonly do no harm to other Taxonomy objectives but also deliver or enable positive contributions to otherTaxonomy objectives.For these reasons, climate mitigation cannot, should not, and has not been, considered in isolation fromthe other five environmental objectives of the Taxonomy. Many of the measures included in the bestpractice tables for substantial contribution to mitigation criteria are agro-ecological practices or naturebased land management activities (e.g. crop rotation, planting hedges), which are win-win or no-regretmeasures. While they contribute substantially to climate mitigation, they also have significant benefits forsoil health, biodiversity, resource efficiency and water protection and thereby increase resilience againstclimatic extremes. In other cases, the synergies with other objectives need to be more carefully pursuedand considerations made that are often context-specific. In particular with respect to livestock production,synergies with sustainability objectives has required careful consideration and balancing productivity /intensity of production with increasing biodiversity value and improving water quality."
"The proposed criteria for agricultural production activities have been developed on the basis of enablingsystemic transition over time. This has in part been pursued so as to prevent system lock-in whereby animmediate action for mitigation prevents or closes down future options for change that could delivergreater mitigation benefits in the sector. For example, the investment in activities that seek to improve theGHG performance of the livestock sector should not prevent more systemic changes in the sectorthrough, for example, greater integration of livestock and crop production (mixed farming), or overallreduction in livestock production. Another example can be taken from the perspective of the use andproduction of biofuels for the transport sector. Whilst more sustainable liquid biofuels have allowed GHGemission reductions from transport energy, they perpetuate the use of internal combustion engines in amitigation development trajectory that may seek more substantial changes, such as electrification ofvehicles, or modal shift."

Brief overview of public consultation feedbackThe TEG thanks all respondents who provided feedback to help improve the agriculture criteria for theTaxonomy. The working group has evaluated the feedback and used the feedback in developing thisreport. The following brief summary highlights the key feedback received and the response to it.
"Stakeholders raised the option of an alternative, more principles-based approach to settingcriteria, based on for example agro-ecological principles. This approach was considered by theworking group, but was felt to be too open-ended to enable a set of criteria to be appliedconsistently by all users, leading to a high risk of significant variation in levels of performance.However, it is the view of the TEG that the criteria (and specifically the best practices detailedhere) align with those principles, and allow sufficient flexibility in their application to meet a varietyof user circumstances, while at the same time requiring a consistent level of performance acrossusers."

"A number of stakeholders noted the need for consistency with existing regulation. In response,efforts have been made to reference to existing EU regulation that aligns with these criteria whereit exists. This is particularly the case for the ‘do no significant harm’ criteria. As noted abovehowever, that a number of these criteria relating to ‘a substantial contribution to mitigation’ areconsistent with, but go beyond, existing regulation."

"A large number of points of feedback were received on specific best practices. These have beenreviewed and considered in depth and changes made to the criteria accordingly following expertconsultation. This includes, but is not limited to, addressing emissions embedded in livestockfeed, and reconsidering the best practice relating to tillage."

"Some stakeholders raised concerns around animal welfare and health status. These do not fallunder the environmental goals of the Taxonomy at this time and therefore were not within theAgricultural Working Group’s remit. However, a recommendation has been made to the Platformto integrate criteria addressing these factors at the earliest possible date."

"Lastly, a number of stakeholders raised concerns over the difficulty in demonstrating compliancewith these criteria. This challenge is recognised by the working group. To assist in addressingthis, the working group has requested that the Platform work with existing agricultural standards,certification schemes, carbon schemes and others to map consistency of requirements betweenthose schemes and these criteria, with the aim of establishing a pool of proxy indicators that canbe taken as evidence of compliance with these criteria."

"There are 10.5 million farms in the EU, using 173 million hectares (ha) of land for agricultural production(about 39% of the EU’s total land area). In 2016 one quarter (25.1%) of these farms are specialistlivestock farms and just over half (52.5%) are specialist crop farms, the rest are composed of mixedfarming (21.1%)128.Most of these farms are small in nature, with two-thirds less than 5 ha in size. But the largest 3.3% ofthem (those over 100 ha in size) manage just over half (52.7%) of all farmland.Agriculture contributed 1.2% to the EU’s GDP in 2017, even without considering its importance as the keybuilding block for the downstream food and beverages processing industry. It employs 9.7 million people,just over 4% of the working population, but these statistics vary significantly by country. In Romania, forexample, nearly a quarter of the working population work in agriculture, and numbers are also high inBulgaria, Greece and Poland.The agricultural sector in the EU invested EUR 57.2 billion in 2017.Global applicabilityGiven the heterogeneity of agriculture, it is challenging to establish a set of one size fits all criteria. Thispoint was raised in the public consultation feedback. However, it is the view of the TEG that these criteriaare globally relevant for low carbon agriculture and with the in-built flexibility on options for demonstratingcompliance, they can be applied globally. To assist with this, the criteria are not tied to specific EUregulations, though cross-reference is made where appropriate to those regulations to assist EU users.Next steps – recommendations to the Platform1. Within and across these economic activities, the following are not (yet) addressed in this round ofTaxonomy criteria but represent significant opportunities for emissions reductions across theagricultural sector as a whole. These opportunities would merit additional consideration by thePlatform:"

"Taking land completely out of agricultural production for the purposes of restoring or reestablishing natural habitats, particularly peatland and other carbon rich landscapes, orintegrating structural elements (such as hedges, buffer strips, woody landscape features) intoagricultural land. There are a number of known benefits such practices, including increasedcarbon sequestration, reduced soil erosion and nutrient loss, and via its positive impact onbiodiversity, support pollination and pest control. The challenge faced when considering whethera ‘land out of production’ and/or ‘integration of structural elements’ practice should be required issetting an ambitious but implementable target. Relevant questions are: what proportion of landshould be covered, how should it be covered, how would this be balanced with other objectives(such as food production) and how could permanence be ensured. Further, given the high cobenefits and inter-relations of such practice across mitigation, biodiversity and generalecosystem health, it is also debatable whether such practices most appropriately fits undersubstantial contribution to mitigation or substantial contribution to healthy ecosystems.

"Switching from higher emitting activities to lower emitting activities. For example, reducing cattlenumbers and increasing legume production as an alternative source of protein, with acorresponding consumption switch between agricultural commodities. At this time, while livestockproduction, and in particular ruminant livestock production (beef, lamb and dairy), is a significantsource of emissions in the agriculture sector, it is included in the Taxonomy due to the significantshort-term mitigation potential associated with reducing emissions intensity in livestockmanagement, and because it is not yet clear what appropriate transition pathways are forlivestock production. In the interim, it is appropriate to maximise the significant mitigation potentialhere, noting the point made above that the best practices for livestock production do not preventor close down further opportunities that might deliver greater mitigation opportunities in thesector. However, it is noted that for absolute emissions from agriculture to continue decreasingbeyond a certain point and to move towards net-zero targets by mid-century, reduced emissionsintensity will need to be coupled as soon as possible with commensurate changes in consumptionpatterns and overall reduced per-capita consumption of livestock products, especially certainbeef, lamb and dairy products.129This implies both societal changes in terms of changing diets and reducing food waste, as well asstructural transformations in the agricultural sector. Significant and coordinated policy efforts willbe required to manage both consumer behavioural changes and to incentivise and managestructural change in the agri-food supply chain. Future Taxonomy updates should, however,consider what rates of meat consumption and/or practices for production are compatible with azero-carbon economy"

"The Platform is asked to consider how these and any other additional actions which deliversignificant mitigation might be identified and evaluated, and how these can be incorporated intothe Taxonomy. This includes determining a rule set to define what counts as significant mitigationfrom individual actions, which may be consistent with similar rule sets across other economicactivities, or common across agricultural activities only, or specific to individual agriculturalactivities.2. It is recommended that the Platform also look further into the addressing the complex interactionswithin agricultural production systems between the six environmental goals of the Taxonomypotential maximise synergies and co-benefits across the 6 environmental goals of the Taxonomy.Specifically:"
"The proposed Taxonomy criteria and practices for agriculture have been developed on the basisof enabling systemic change, rather than focusing on individual ‘fixes’ to the mitigation challenge.The proposed practices consider implications beyond mitigation alone and seek, where possibleto support contribution to the wider environmental and climate adaptation objectives of theTaxonomy Regulation. This work should be developed further. The Platform should draw onexisting and emerging evidence to consider further not just how substantial mitigation can bepursued without causing significant harm to other objectives, but rather to pursue approaches thatfurther optimize synergies and minimize trade-offs between significant contribution to mitigation,adaptation and biodiversity, water, and soil management. This also includes improvedconsideration of how the benefits of mixed farming systems can better be captured in theTaxonomy."

"In addition, livestock production comprises a broad range of practices, including intensive andlandless operations, which can have particular environmental impacts beyond GHG emissions.There were insufficient resources to analyse the current evidence base in depth in order to allowfor a differentiated treatment of different forms of livestock production from a DNSH angle and it isrecommended that the Platform look into this further."
3. Regarding expanding the scope of the environmental goals of the Taxonomy:
"Although animal welfare and health status and the side-effects of antibiotic use in the livestocksector are currently not part of the DNSH criteria as they do not fall under the environmentalgoals prioritised at this time, the stakeholder consultation, as well as available research130 showsthat these are significant societal expectations associated with livestock production 131. As such, arecommendation to the Platform is that criteria addressing animal welfare and health areintegrated at the earliest possible date."
"4. To address challenges around applying and demonstrating compliance with the criteria in thediversity of agricultural contexts, the Platform is asked to consider the following:"
"E.g. http://www.risefoundation.eu/images/files/2018/2018_RISE_LIVESTOCK_FULL.pdf “Whatever level of EU livestockproduction, now and in the future, it is essential that continued progress is made on four fronts: improving resource efficiency,reducing leakages into the environment, increasing the health status and welfare of farmed animals, and minimising the use ofantibiotics.”130"

What guidance would be necessary to support land managers in implementing the criteria andpractices set out in the Taxonomy so as to realise synergies and avoid trade-offs betweenobjectives. This would lay the ground-work for the Taxonomy as it evolves from DNSH tosubstantial contribution across all environmental objectives. The platform is asked to consider twoelements in this regard:o
o

"How and whether it is appropriate to deliver country or regionally tailored adviceregarding the applicability of each best practice listed in that localised context. Whilstmost best practices are generic in nature and set out the main approaches to delivering asubstantial contribution to mitigation in agriculture, the global reach of the Taxonomynaturally means that some practices in temperate regions may not be as applicable insub-tropical areas, etc.;To consider how and what guidance could be provided and by whom, to allow thoseimplementing the practices for substantial mitigation to do so in a way that benefits otherenvironmental objectives and/ or simultaneously ensures no significant harm to otherenvironmental objectives. For example, the sowing of catch and cover crops is likely todeliver significant contribution to water quality objectives by stabilising soils in periods ofhigh run-off, preventing silting and the movement of nutrients to water bodies. Advicecould be framed around the location, within a farm, where such practices would deliverparticular benefits to water quality, such as in high nutrient load areas, on slopes, andareas adjacent to water bodies. To assist with this, the TEG has included indictors in thebest practice tables to identify which best practices have potential co-benefits with theother environmental goals of the Taxonomy."
What can be done to support the development or adoption of tools and methodologies to assist indemonstrating compliance with these criteria. Specifically:o
"A large number of carbon audit tools are available at present, although there is variationin the coverage and robustness of these tools. A recent review132 conducted in Scotlandidentified three tools deemed technically very suitable for farm-level carbon audits in theScottish context, enabling sufficient robustness, comprehensiveness and clarity ofdocumentation: Cool Farm Tool133, Scottish AgRE Calculator134, and JRC Carboncalculator135. At least the Cool Farm Tool and JRC Carbon Calculator are also morebroadly applicable in the EU. The FAO-Ex-act tool might also be appropriate to use. Itwould be valuable if the Platform could provide guidance on appropriate tools fordemonstrating compliance and support further development of the existing tools toaddress capacity building and compliance checking needs associated with a transition tolow-carbon farming."

The adoption of such proxy indicatorswould help substantially in the cost-effective demonstration of compliance with thesecriteria and thresholds."

"Likewise, efforts have been made to cross reference these criteria to the post-2020 CAPfor EU users. This is a work in progress made complicated by the fact that the post-2020CAP has not been adopted at this time.

The need or not to flex the criteria for different users in different circumstances. In particular:o
"As currently proposed, in the main, the Criteria apply equally to, and do not distinguishbetween, smaller and large scale farms. This seems appropriate in terms of seeking toaddress emissions reductions and sequestration in farms of all sizes to maximiseaggregate impact, recognising that small farms can be some of the most inefficient andemitting, and large firms can be some of the most efficient per unit of output, and viceversa. However, the Platform is asked to consider whether differences should be madein terms of the requirements to demonstrate compliance, recognising the highertransaction cost impacts for smaller scale farmers.o As noted above, the TEG are of the view that these criteria and thresholds have globalapplicability, based on input from TEG members and expert advisers with globalexpertise and experience. However, additional global consultation will be needed toconfirm the appropriateness of these proposals for crop and livestock production aroundthe world.5. To keep these criteria up-to-date, the Platform is asked to:"
Regularly review this list of practices to integrate new advances in understanding and scientificknowledge and any implications of amendments to the Common Agricultural Policy.
"6. Lastly, as noted above, these criteria focus on the significant mitigation potential that can be realisedin the way these crops and resources are produced, regardless of their end use. They do not takeinto account any contribution that agricultural products can make to mitigation via the bioeconomy.The Platform is asked to consider this aspect further to determine whether and under whatcircumstances alternative criteria for (some) agricultural production or producers might beappropriate in light of potential substantial contributions they can enable in downstream economicactivities that are part of the bioeconomy."

Description
Growing of perennial crops
Mitigation criteriaPrinciples
Both of the principles set out here must be fulfilled:1. Demonstrate substantial avoidance or reduction of GHGemissions from production and related practices; and2. Maintain existing sinks and increase sequestration (up tosaturation point) in above- and below-ground carbon stocks.
Thresholds and metrics
1) Avoid or reduce GHG emissions (including those frominputs used on the farm) through the application ofappropriate management practices.This can be demonstrated in either of the following ways:-
The essential management practices are deployedconsistently over the applicable perennial crop productionarea each yearOR
-
Reduction in GHG emissions (gCO2e) in line with thefollowing trajectory
"For example, a 20% reduction in GHG emissions would be requiredby 2030 compared to emissions in 2020, and a 30% emissionsreduction would be required by 2040 compared to 2020112"
2) Maintain and increase existing carbon stocks for a periodequal to or greater than 20 years through the application ofappropriate management practices.This can be demonstrated in either of the following ways:-
The essential management practices^ are deployedconsistently over the applicable perennial crop area eachyearOR
-
Above and below ground carbon stocks (tC/ha) to beincreased progressively over a minimum 20-year period*
"* Noting the following exception: For soils specifically, where it canbe demonstrated that saturation levels have been reached, no furtherincrease in carbon content is expected. In this case, existing levelsshould be maintained"
"3) Production is not undertaken on land that had any of thefollowing status in or after January 2008 and no longer hasthat status.136a) Wetlands, namely land that is covered with or saturated bywater permanently or for a significant part of the year;b) Continuously forested areas, namely land spanning morethan one hectare with trees higher than five metres and acanopy cover of more than 30 %, or trees able to reach thosethresholds in situ;c) Land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher thanfive metres and a canopy cover of between 10 % and 30 %,or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ 137;d) Peatland, unless evidence is provided that the cultivation andharvesting of that raw material does not involve drainage ofpreviously undrained soil."
Methodological notes:For those demonstrating compliance with the essential managementpractices:
136
"This requirement is taken from RED II, Article 29, paragraphs 4 and 5. It is be applied to all perennial crop production, whetherfor biofuels, bioliquids or biomass, or for food or feed uses. The intention is per RED II, namely to ensure high carbon stock land isnot converted for the purposes for agricultural production.137"
"Unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology ofpart C of Annex V of RED II is applied, the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of Article 29 of RED II would be fulfilled."
113
-
-
"The essential management practices are described in thetable below. All essential practices will need to be deployed,except where particular practices can be demonstrated to benot applicable to that farm holding given the particularbiophysical conditions at that farm holding."
-
"In respect of the essential practice relating to the GHGassessment, this assessment should be done using tools thatcover all relevant emissions on the farm associated withproduction, as well as emissions associated with energy andfuel use (see below for relevant GHG categories). If it can bedemonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currentlyaccessible to farmers in a given location (either because oflanguage or lack of access to farm advisory support), thispractice may be omitted in the first instance. Theassessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five yearperiod. The assessment is a self-assessment using anappropriate tool, no independent audit or verification of theGHG assessment is required."
-
"To demonstrate compliance with all other essential practices,it will be necessary to establish a farm sustainabilitymanagement plan which describes the managementpractices being deployed - taking into account crophusbandry requirements, farm pedo-climatic conditions - andtheir coverage on the farm. To prepare the farmsustainability management plan a carbon calculator can beused, or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrientdecision-support tools."
For those demonstrating compliance with GHG thresholds:-
"To demonstrate compliance with the quantitative GHGthresholds it will be necessary to establish a Carbon stockand GHG emission baseline for the farm (see below forrelevant GHG categories). It will be against such baselinedata that emission reductions of Carbon increases can bemeasured. A carbon audit is necessary in order to alsoassess where action is needed, and this must beaccompanied by a carbon management plan to set out themanagement practices that will deliver the GHG emissionsreduction/ carbon sequestration. This carbon managementplan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan."
-
"Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production beingfinanced is less than 20 years, to show broad compliancewith the requirement for carbon stocks to increaseprogressively over a 20 year period, assurance should besought on the likely replanting of crops to promote thepermanence of carbon sequestration trends. It is recognisedthat uprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger114"
"stage crops with a potential fallow/ restoration periodbetween will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks and someemissions. With this in mind, the objective is to ensure overallmaintenance of carbon stocks and/ or upward trends insequestration are sought over multiple rotations.-"
For all users:-
"Calculations of carbon stocks and GHG emissions levelsshould include the following, though it is recognised that inpractice, the scope of GHG counted will be subject to thetechnical capabilities of the GHG accounting tools beingused:o"
CO2 emissions and removals in above groundbiomass
o
CO2 emissions and removals in below groundbiomass and soils
o
"N2O emissions from exposed soils, fertiliserapplication, and those embedded in fertiliserproduction and fertiliser application"
o
CH4 emissions from livestock (enteric fermentationand manure management) and some soils (e.g.wetlands)
o
CO2 emissions from fuel and electricity use
-
"Emissions, sinks and management practices are all to beaudited at 3-year intervals to confirm ongoing compliancewith these requirements."
-
In the case of force majeure: emissions resulting from naturaldisturbance can be excluded from impacting on theachievement of the thresholds and will not affect theapplication of these requirements or result in non-compliancewith these criteria.

"RationaleOpportunities for substantial mitigation and contributions to a net zero carbon economyAn overarching goal of the Taxonomy is to enable the screening of economic activities to determinewhether or when they do or do not deliver substantial mitigation, consistent with the underlying goal ofa net zero carbon economy by 2050.In the context of agriculture, Net-Zero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot bereduced to zero, they can be compensated for through increased removals (through carbonsequestration) on farmed land. The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) be117"
"met solely in agriculture remains open. It may not be possible to reach net-zero emissions on anindividual farm holding in all cases. In other cases, it may be more feasible. At the aggregate level, itmay be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas, wouldstruggle to reach net-zero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country. This raisesthe question as to the extent to which a given farm, or aggregation of farms, could reach net-zero andthe extent to which these farms could appropriate negative emissions (sequestration) from other farmsor other sectors.Furthermore, one opportunity for emissions reductions in the agriculture sector as a whole is to switchfrom higher emitting activities to lower emitting activities (for example, by reducing cattle numbers andincreasing legume production as an alternative source of protein), with a corresponding consumptionswitch between agricultural commodities. These criteria and thresholds, which focus specifically onemissions within the perennial crop production activity, cannot address this type of mitigation action.The criteria and thresholds proposed therefore focus on ensuring that emissions are substantiallyreduced and removals substantially increased at the economic activity (NACE code) level.There is significant potential to reduce emissions, maintain carbon sinks, and increase sequestrationthrough good practices in perennial cropland management. Each of these needs to be addressed inorder to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantial mitigation and contributes its part to anet zero carbon economy. Doing so will ensure each instance of perennial cropland managementmaximises its contribution – this rationale drove the principles set out above."
"Approach taken to setting thresholds for this economic activityThere continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if suchinformation existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds for implementationwould remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice.However, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e) is possible, where these can bemade relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or project. Whilst this provides some quantitativemeans of assessing mitigation performance, it is a relatively blunt mechanism as it does not take intoaccount emissions reductions which might previously have been achieved and if the farm is alreadydelivering significant mitigation. Therefore, it is harder for a farm that already performs relatively well todeliver an additional X% reduction in emissions than it is for a form that currently performs relativelypoorly. Furthermore, to determine compliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at farmlevel is necessary. However, this is not yet mainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools andapproaches.The proposals, therefore, allow for a different approach, namely the demonstration of the deploymentof specific bundles of management practices, that are recognised as essential to delivering low carbonproduction in agriculture. This more qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor, and there areexisting mechanisms to do so, such as under the CAP. It also provides a more directly communicableapproach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on the ground. As thisapproach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well as those that willadditional investment finance to do so, it also allows for the recognition of farms (and associated assets118"
"and equity) that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG footprint. As such, it avoids theproblems associated with the relative GHG threshold as described above.Emission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources: entericfermentation (42.9%; 0.186 GtCO2e); management of agricultural soils (38%; 0.165 GtCO2e); andmanure management (15.4%; 0.067 GtCO2e) (2014 figures). Mitigation potential thereforepredominantly involves reductions in non-CO2 emissions as these form the majority of agricultureemissions in the EU, with CO2 from on-farm energy use being a minor component (covering only0.13% of total EU28+ISL agriculture emissions in 2014). The largest share of the EU’s agricultural nonCO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH 4). Nitrousoxide accounts for 58% of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture (largely from fertiliser application andexposed soils, as well as grazing animals), with methane accounting for the remaining 42% (largelyfrom livestock and rice cultivation). In some cases, GHG emission from energy (traction, heating,cooling, irrigation) can form a significant proportion of emissions arising from the farm. The proposedbest practices therefore include a provision for when GHG emissions from energy are greater than20% of farm emissions, these should be reduced by 20% through efficiency and energy sourcerequirements.In respect of perennial cropland production, key sources of emissions are emissions associated withsoil management and the application of fertilisers, and emissions embedded in post-harvest waste."
"Metrics and thresholds for this economic activityOn management practices that deliver substantial mitigationRationale for the selection of practices: Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possiblemitigation practices available in the agricultural sector to address the different emissions andopportunities for sequestration in perennial cropland management.For the purpose of establishing criteria and thresholds which identify when the economic activity ofperennial cropland delivers substantial mitigation, individual management practices were identified forwhich: 1) there is sufficient existing scientific knowledge and consensus on the mitigation effects andinteractions with other environmental and food security objectives; and 2) the scale, certainty andconsistency of mitigation effects is sufficiently demonstrated (for example, Smith et al. 2008140, Paustianet al. 2016141, Kay et al. 2019142).These management practices have been demonstrated to improve soil health and soil productivity so asto secure agricultural yields and thus reduce the emission intensity of crop production – outcomes criticalfor the delivery of substantial mitigation - and/ or reduce the carbon intensity of agriculture, and also donot risk leakage effects. They also do not risk negative ancillary effects nor are in conflict with legislation"

"in the EU. These practices deliver substantial mitigation with relatively high certainty across a range ofbiophysical and farming conditions.Scientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories of individual practices and alsoindicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads to substantialmitigation, i.e. an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which are environmentallysustainable should be pursued (Paustian et al. 2016). The literature, however, provides limited guidanceon how to translate sectoral or activity-based mitigation potential into individual farm-level mitigationpotential, i.e. what combination of practices should be applied together as a minimum at farm level indifferent conditions to deliver substantial mitigation. Therefore, TEG expert input was used to determinethe minimum combination of practices which should be applied together for perennial croplandmanagement to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level.The table below indicates the management practices selected as the bundle of essential practices that,deployed collectively, should deliver substantial mitigation at farm level. It is noted that givenheterogeneity of farms, deployment of the same bundle of practices may result in different emissionsimpacts farm to farm, but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle will deliver substantialmitigation in the majority of cases. The applicable area for management practices relates to wherethose practices could and should be deployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives. For example,buffer strips designed to prevent soil erosion and run-off are to be placed next to water courses andditches, etc. Therefore, some practices may only be deployed on a small area of the farm where theyadd value.One best practice, the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reducedemissions or increased sequestration. The rationale for including this practice is to raise awareness ofwhere the main emission sources are on a farm holding, what opportunities exist to reduce thoseemissions and thus where greatest mitigation impact could be achieved, including through opportunitiesfor carbon sinks, and thereby improve the targeting of mitigation action. In this spirit, no verification oraudit of the assessment is required to fulfil this best practice requirement. This is different from thequantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit, both of which are necessary when demonstratingcompliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds. The assessment should be done using tools that coverall relevant emissions on the farm associated with crop, livestock production, as well as emissionsassociated with energy and fuel use. If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currentlyaccessible to farmers in a given location (either because of language or lack of access to farm advisorysupport), this practice may be omitted in the first instance.

"On GHG emission reduction thresholdsSubstantial, in the context of substantial mitigation, falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net negative (where removals exceed emissions), net-zero (where removals balance with emissions) tovarying degrees of emission reductions. With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductionsfrom the agriculture sector as a whole or perennial crop production specifically the degree to whichemission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need. It isalso noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach, and thus any level of ‘substantial’ should beconsistent in the global context."

"A review by Wollenberg et al, 2016143 suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between0.9 – 1.4 GtCO2e (in 2030) to meet the 2 °C target, 1 GtCO2e (in 2030). This was selected as anapproximate target. These figures relate primarily to non-CO2 emissions and are “an annualized”, notcumulative, goal. The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 6.15–7.78 GtCO2e yr-1 foragriculture in 2030. The goal represents an 11–18% reduction relative to the scenarios’ respective2030 business as usual baselines”144. As these figures represent non-CO2 emissions, they implicitly donot recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals.As such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20% over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 hasbeen proposed as ‘significant contribution’ in the context of the Taxonomy. This is supported by workfrom Frank et al (2018)145, and The IPCC’s fourth assessment report (Smith et al, 2007) 146.In terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture, the work by Wollenberg et al(2016) calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to2100. The emissions curve (level of emissions over time) increases and decreases at different points,relative to existing efforts, projected changes in external factors, etc. The average reduction figureneeded over this whole timeframe is 28% emission reductions compared to the baseline. As we movetowards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases, and this implications forany threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe. The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger(approximately a doubling). Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linearbetween the years, for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20% reduction by2030 and 40% reduction by 2050 as a linear trajectory of emission reductions also simplifiesimplementation and communication.The study determined these reductions against a business as usual scenario for agriculture. However,establishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limit implementationeffectiveness, as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming the mitigation action wasnot in place. For simplicity, the proposed approach is therefore to simplify the requirement to compareemissions at the start of period with those achieved in 10 years-time and assess this against the targetreduction.The threshold metric for emissions reduction is gCO2e, and not an emissions intensity metric such asgCO2e/ unit of production, as this enables the Taxonomy to be applied by those reducing emissionsintensity (e.g. through energy or resource efficiency) while also requiring them to reduce emissionsoverall – the overall goal."

"On setting Carbon stock thresholdsSetting a universal (or global) absolute threshold (in terms of tC/ ha) for carbon stocks is not a viableoption given the variability of carbon sequestration and stocking potential – which is very contextspecific. Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration inline with a universal, absolute threshold. Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions(based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site) is not possible as at present is it isimpractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential (i.e. saturation point) of a specificarea. Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type, and therefore are not trulycontext specific.Furthermore, even defining a specific % of carbon increase required is more challenging than settingthe relative threshold for reducing emissions. Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level ofemissions at a given point, therefore a 20% reduction over 10 years for example can be expected todeliver a ‘substantial’ contribution from an underperforming farm (resulting in high overall emissionreductions). However, the premise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agriculturalland as there is relatively little evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stockincrease would be needed on agricultural land in a 1.5 or 2°C climate stabilisation target scenario, asthis is relative to the level of emissions from that same land (if one is pursuing a net-zero approach) orthe level of carbon sequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy. It is however,recognised that C sequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculturesector at global scale, while emission savings of non-CO2 emissions may be more important in the EUwith a prevailing intensive production system. Smith et al (2007) estimate that 89% of the technicalpotential of emission reductions in the sector to 2030 and 2050 lies in soil carbon sequestration, i.e.inreducing net CO2 emissions from farming practices and management, including croplandmanagement, grazing land management, restoration of cultivated organic soils and restoration ofdegraded lands.The proposal is therefore to require evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of increasingcarbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of carbon stocks over a 20-year period. A 20 yearperiod for C stock saturation maintenance is proposed in line with the IPCC 20 year soil C saturationperiod. Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production being financed is less than 20 years,assurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbonsequestration trends. It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger stagecrops with a potential fallow/ restoration period between will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks andsome emissions. With this in mind, the objective is to ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocksand/ or upward trends in sequestration are sought over multiple rotations.On no conversion of high carbon stock landA cut-off date of 2008 for no conversion of high carbon stock land is chosen to be consistent with theoperation of the Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria relative to these land types. Thisprovides a link with existing sustainability schemes through which compliance could be demonstratedfor this criterion."
122
"On demonstrating compliance with these criteria and thresholds3-year compliance checking is proposed to ensure progress is being made and mitigation is beingdelivered in practice, and also to reduce the burden necessary on operators. This compliance checkingis required for management practice checking, C stock change and GHG reductions.To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan canalso be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools.

Description
Growing of non-perennial crops
Mitigation criteriaPrinciples
Both of the principles set out here must be fulfilled:1. Demonstrate substantial avoidance or reduction of GHG emissionsfrom production and related practices; and2. Maintain existing sinks and increase sequestration (up to saturationpoint) in above- and below-ground carbon stocks.
Threshold & metrics
1) Avoid or reduce GHG emissions (including those from inputs used onthe farm) through the application of appropriate managementpractices.This can be demonstrated in either of the following ways:-
-
"The essential management practices are deployed consistently overthe applicable non-perennial crop production area each yearORReduction in GHG emissions (gCO2e) for the area of non-perennialproduction, in line with the following trajectory:"
"For example, over the 10 year period of 2020-2030, a 20% reduction in GHGemissions would be required. Over the 20 year period of 2020-2040, a 30%reduction in GHG emissions would be required.126"
2) Maintain and increase existing carbon stocks for a period equal to orgreater than 20 years through the application of appropriatemanagement practices.This can be demonstrated in either of the following ways:-
The essential management practices are deployed consistently overthe applicable non-perennial crop area each yearOR
-
Above and below ground carbon stocks (tC/ha) to be increasedprogressively over a minimum 20-year period*
"* Noting the following exception: For soils specifically, where it can bedemonstrated that saturation levels have been reached, no further increase incarbon content is expected. In this case, existing levels should be maintained"
"3) Production is not undertaken on land that had any of the followingstatus in or after January 2008 and no longer has that status. 156a) Wetlands, namely land that is covered with or saturated by waterpermanently or for a significant part of the yearb) Continuously forested areas, namely land spanning more than onehectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of morethan 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ;c) Land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than fivemetres and a canopy cover of between 10 % and 30 %, or trees able toreach those thresholds in situ; 157d) Peatland, unless evidence is provided that the cultivation andharvesting of that raw material does not involve drainage of previouslyundrained soil."
Methodological notes:For those demonstrating compliance with the essential management practices:-
"The essential management practices are described in the table below.All essential practices will need to be deployed, except where particular"
156
"This requirement is taken from RED II, Article 29, paragraphs 4 and 5. It is be applied to all perennial crop production, whetherfor biofuels, bioliquids or biomass, or for food or feed uses. The intention is per RED II, namely, to ensure high carbon stock land isnot converted for the purposes for agricultural production.157"
"Unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology ofpart C of Annex V of RED II is applied, the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of Article 29 of RED II would be fulfilled."
127
practices can be demonstrated to be not applicable to that farm holdinggiven the particular biophysical conditions at that farm holding.-
"In respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG assessment,this assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevantemissions on the farm associated with production, as well as emissionsassociated with energy and fuel use (see below for relevant GHGcategories). If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment toolis currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because oflanguage or lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice maybe omitted in the first instance. The assessment, however, becomesmandatory within a five year period. The assessment is a selfassessment using an appropriate tool, no independent audit orverification of the GHG assessment is required."
-
"To demonstrate compliance with all other essential practices, it will benecessary to establish a farm sustainability management plan whichdescribes the management practices being deployed - taking intoaccount crop husbandry requirements, farm pedo-climatic conditions and their coverage on the farm. To prepare the farm sustainabilitymanagement plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan canalso be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools."
-
For those demonstrating compliance with GHG thresholds:
-
"To demonstrate compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds it willbe necessary to establish a Carbon stock and GHG emission baselinefor the farm (see below for relevant GHG categories). It will be againstsuch baseline data that emission reductions of Carbon increases canbe measured. A carbon audit is necessary in order to also assesswhere action is needed, and this must be accompanied by a carbonmanagement plan to set out the management practices that will deliverthe GHG emissions reduction/ carbon sequestration. This carbonmanagement plan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan."
-
"Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production being financed isless than 20 years, to show broad compliance with the requirement forcarbon stocks to increase progressively over a 20 year period,assurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promotethe permanence of carbon sequestration trends. It is recognised thatuprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger stage crops with apotential fallow/ restoration period between will lead to a reduction incarbon stocks and some emissions. With this in mind, the objective isto ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocks and/ or upward trendsin sequestration are sought over multiple rotations."
-
For all users:
-
"Calculations of carbon stocks and GHG emissions levels shouldinclude the following, though it is recognised that in practice, the scopeof GHG counted will be subject to the technical capabilities of the GHGaccounting tools being used:128"
o
CO2 emissions and removals in above ground biomass
o
CO2 emissions and removals in below ground biomass andsoils
o
"N2O emissions from exposed soils, fertiliser application, andthose embedded in fertiliser production and fertiliser application"
o
CH4 emissions from livestock (enteric fermentation andmanure management) and some soils (e.g. wetlands)
o
CO2 emissions from fuel and electricity use
-
"Emissions, sinks and management practices are all to be audited at 3year intervals to confirm ongoing compliance with these requirements."
-
In the case of force majeure: emissions resulting from naturaldisturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of thethresholds and will not affect the application of these requirements orresult in non-compliance with these criteria.

"RationaleOpportunities for substantial mitigation and contributions to a net zero carbon economyAn overarching goal of the Taxonomy is to enable the screening of economic activities to determinewhether or when they do or do not deliver substantial mitigation, consistent with the overarching goal ofa net zero carbon economy by 2050.In the context of agriculture, Net-Zero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot bereduced to zero, they can be compensated for through increased removals (through carbonsequestration) on farmed land. The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) bemet solely in agriculture remains open. It may not be possible to reach net-zero emissions on anindividual farm holding in all cases. In other cases, it may be more feasible. At the aggregate level, it131"
"may be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas, wouldstruggle to reach net-zero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country. This raisesthe question as to the extent to which a given farm, or aggregation of farms, could reach net-zero andthe extent to which these farms could appropriate negative emissions (sequestration) from other farmsor other sectors. Furthermore, one opportunity for emissions reductions in the agriculture sector as awhole is to switch from higher emitting activities to lower emitting activities (for example, by movingfrom conventional production using artificial fertiliser to organic farming), with a correspondingconsumption switch between agricultural commodities. These criteria and thresholds, which focusspecifically on emissions within the non-perennial crop production activity, cannot address this type ofmitigation potential.The criteria and thresholds proposed therefore focus on ensuring that emissions are substantiallyreduced and removals substantially increased at the economic activity (NACE code) level.There is significant potential to reduce emissions, maintain carbon sinks, and increase sequestrationthrough good practices in non-perennial cropland management. Each of these needs to be addressedin order to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantial mitigation and contributes its part to anet-zero carbon economy. Doing so will ensure each instance of non-perennial cropland managementmaximises its contribution – this rationale drove the principles set out above."
"Approach taken to setting thresholds for this economic activityThere continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if suchinformation existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds for implementation,would remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice implementation.However, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e/ ha or % change in gCO2e/unit ofproduction) is possible, where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm orproject. Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance, it is arelatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which mightpreviously have been achieved and if the farm is already delivering significant mitigation. Therefore, itis harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X% reduction inemissions than it is for a farm that currently performs relatively poorly. Furthermore, to determinecompliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at the farm level is necessary. However, thisis not yet mainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches.The proposals, therefore, allow for a different approach, namely the demonstration of the deploymentof specific bundles of management practices, which are recognised as essential to delivering lowcarbon production in agriculture. This more qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor, andthere are existing mechanisms to do so, such as under the CAP. It also provides a more directlycommunicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on theground. As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as wellas those that will require additional investment finance to do so, it also allows for the recognition offarms (and associated assets and equity) that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG"

"footprint. As such, this approach avoids the problems associated with the relative GHG threshold asdescribed above.Emission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources: entericfermentation (42.9%; 0.186 GtCO2e); management of agricultural soils (38%; 0.165 GtCO2e); andmanure management (15.4%; 0.067 GtCO2e) (2014 figures). Mitigation potential thereforepredominantly involves reductions in non-CO2 emissions as these form the majority of agricultureemissions in the EU, with CO2 from on-farm energy use being a minor component (covering only0.13% of total EU28+ISL agriculture emissions in 2014). The largest share of the EU’s agricultural nonCO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH 4). Nitrousoxide accounts for 58% of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture (largely from fertiliser application andexposed soils, as well as grazing animals), with methane accounting for the remaining 42% (largelyfrom livestock and rice cultivation). In some cases, GHG emission from energy (traction, heating,cooling, irrigation) can form a significant proportion of emissions arising from the farm. The proposedbest practices therefore include a provision for when GHG emissions from energy are greater than20% of farm emissions, these should be reduced by 20% through efficiency and energy sourcerequirements.In respect of non-perennial cropland production, key sources of emissions are emissions associatedwith soil management and the application of fertilisers, methane emissions from rice cultivation, andavoided emissions embedded in crop waste."
"Metrics and thresholds for this economic activityOn management practices that deliver substantial mitigationRationale for the selection of practices: Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possiblemanagement practices available in the agricultural sector to address the different emissions andopportunities for sequestration in non-perennial cropland management. For the purpose ofestablishing criteria and thresholds which identify when the economic activity of non-perennial croplanddelivers substantial mitigation, individual management practices were identified for which: 1) there issufficient existing scientific knowledge and consensus on the mitigation effects and interactions withother environmental and food security objectives; and 2) the scale, certainty and consistency ofmitigation effects is sufficiently demonstrated (for example, Smith et al. 2008 160, Paustian et al. 2016161,Kay et al. 2019162).These management practices have been demonstrated to improve soil health and soil productivity soas to secure agricultural yields and thus reduce the emission intensity of crop production – outcomescritical for the delivery of substantial mitigation. The selected practices include reducing the carbonintensity of agriculture, and also do not risk leakage effects. They also do not risk negative ancillary"

"effects nor are in conflict with legislation in the EU. These practices deliver substantial mitigation withrelatively high certainty across a range of biophysical and farming conditions.Scientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories of individual practices andalso indicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads tosubstantial mitigation, i.e. an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which areenvironmentally sustainable should be pursued (Paustian et al. 2016). The literature, however,provides limited guidance on how to translate sectoral or activity-based mitigation potential intoindividual farm-level mitigation potential, i.e. what combination of practices should be applied togetheras a minimum at farm level in different conditions to deliver substantial mitigation. Therefore, TEGexpert input was used to determine the minimum combination of practices which should be appliedtogether for non-perennial cropland management to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level.The table below indicates the management practices selected as the bundle of essential practices that,deployed collectively, should deliver substantial mitigation at farm level. It is noted that givenheterogeneity of farms, deployment of the same bundle of practices may result in different emissionsimpacts farm to farm, but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle will deliver substantialmitigation in the majority of cases.The applicable area for management practices relates to where those practices could and should bedeployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives. For example, buffer strips designed to prevent soilerosion and run-off are to be placed next to water courses and ditches, etc. Therefore, some practicesmay only be deployed on a small area of the farm where they add value.One best practice, the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reducedemissions or increased sequestration. The rationale for including this practice it to raise awareness ofwhere the main emission sources are on a farm holding, what opportunities exist and thus where greatestmitigation impact could be achieved, including through opportunities for carbon sinks, and therebyimprove the targeting of mitigation action. In this spirit, no verification or audit of the assessment isrequired. This is different from the quantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit, both of which arenecessary when demonstrating compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds. The assessmentshould be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with crop, livestockproduction, as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use. If it can be demonstrated that nocarbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location (either because of languageor lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice may be omitted in the first instance. Theassessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period,"
"On GHG emission reduction thresholdsSubstantial, in the context of substantial mitigation, falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net negative (where removals exceed emissions), net-zero (where removals balance with emissions) tovarying degrees of emission reductions. With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductionsfrom the agriculture sector as a whole or non-perennial crop production specifically, the degree towhich emission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need.It is also noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach, and thus any level of ‘substantial’ should beconsistent in the global context."

"A review by Wollenberg et al, 2016163 suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between0.9 – 1.4 GtCO2e (in 2030) to meet the 2 °C target, 1 GtCO2e (in 2030). This was selected as anapproximate target. These figures relate primarily to non-CO2 emissions and are “an annualized”, notcumulative, goal. The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 6.15–7.78 GtCO2e yr-1 foragriculture in 2030. The goal represents an 11–18% reduction relative to the scenarios’ respective2030 business as usual baselines”164. As these figures represent non-CO2 emissions, they implicitly donot recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals.As such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20% over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 hasbeen proposed as ‘significant contribution’ in the context of the Taxonomy. This is supported by workfrom Frank et al (2018)165, and The IPCC’s fourth assessment report (Smith et al, 2007)166.In terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture, the work by Wollenberg et al(2016) calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to2100. The emissions curve (level of emissions over time) increases and decreases at different points,relative to existing efforts, projected changes in external factors, etc. The average reduction figureneeded over this whole timeframe is 28% emission reductions compared to the baseline. As we movetowards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases, and this implications forany threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe. The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger(approximately a doubling). Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linearbetween the years, for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20% reduction by2030 and 40% reduction by 2050 as a linear trajectory of emission reductions also simplifiesimplementation and communication.The study determined these reductions against a business as usual (BaU) scenario for agriculture.However, establishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limitimplementation effectiveness, as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming themitigation action was not in place. For simplicity, the proposed approach is therefore to simplify therequirement to compare emissions at the start of period with those achieved over the period andassess this against the target reduction for that period.The threshold metric is gCO2e, and not an intensity metric such as gCO2e/ unit of production, as thisenables the Taxonomy to be applied by both those reducing emission intensity (e.g. through efficiency)while also requiring them to reduce emissions overall – the overall goal."

"Setting a universal (or global) absolute threshold (in terms of tC/ ha) for carbon stocks is not a viableoption given the variability of carbon sequestration and stocking potential – which is very contextspecific. Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration inline with a universal, absolute threshold. Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions(based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site) is not possible as at present is it isimpractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential (i.e. saturation point) of a specificarea. Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type, and therefore are not trulycontext specific.Furthermore, even defining a specific % of carbon increase required is more challenging than settingthe relative threshold for reducing emissions. Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level ofemissions at a given point, therefore a 20% reduction can be expected to deliver a ‘substantial’contribution from an underperforming farm (resulting in high overall emission reductions). However, thepremise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural land as there is relativelylittle evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock increase would be needed onagricultural land in a 1.5 or 2°C climate stabilisation target scenario, as this is relative to the level ofemissions from that same land (if one is pursuing a net-zero approach) or the level of carbonsequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy. It is however, recognised that Csequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculture sector at globalscale, while emission savings of non-CO2 emissions may be more important in the EU with a prevailingintensive production system. Smith et al (2007) estimate that 89% of the technical potential of emissionreductions in the sector to 2030 and 2050 lies in soil carbon sequestration, i.e.in reducing net CO2emissions from farming practices and management, including cropland management, grazing landmanagement, restoration of cultivated organic soils and restoration of degraded lands.The proposal is therefore to require evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of increasingcarbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of carbon stocks over a 20-year period. A 20 yearperiod for C stock saturation maintenance is proposed in line with the IPCC 20 year soil C saturationperiod. Where the (remaining) lifecycle of the crop production being financed is less than 20 years,assurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbonsequestration trends. It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new, younger stagecrops with a potential fallow/ restoration period between will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks andsome emissions. With this in mind, the objective is to ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocksand/ or upward trends in sequestration are sought over multiple rotations."

"1. Demonstrate substantial avoidance or reduction of GHG emissions fromlivestock production (including animal management, storage andprocessing of manure and slurry, and management of permanentgrasslands)2. Maintain existing sinks and increase sequestration (up to saturationpoint) of carbon in permanent grassland.Where livestock production does not include permanent grassland, onlyprinciple 1 applies.Permanent grassland is land used to grow grasses or other herbaceousforage, either naturally (self-seeded including 'rough grazing') or throughcultivation (sown), and which is more than five years old."
Threshold & metrics
1) Avoid or reduce GHG emissions (including those from inputs usedon the farm) through the application of appropriate managementpractices.This can be demonstrated in either of the following ways:-
The essential management practices are deployed consistently overthe applicable livestock operation each yearOR
140
-
Reduction in GHG emissions (gCO2e) in line with the followingtrajectory
"For example, over the 10 year period of 2020-2030, a 20% reduction in GHGemissions would be required. Over the 20 year period of 2020-2040, a 30%reduction in GHG emissions would be required."
2) Maintain and increase existing carbon stocks for a period equal toor greater than 20 years through the application of appropriatemanagement practices.This can be demonstrated in either of the following ways:-
The essential management practices are consistently deployed overthe applicable permanent grassland area each yearOR
-
Above and below ground carbon stocks shall increase progressivelyover a 20-year period*
"* Noting the following exception: For soils specifically, where it can bedemonstrated that saturation levels have been reached, no further increasein carbon content is expected. In this case, existing levels should bemaintained"
"3) Production is not undertaken on land that had any of the followingstatus in or after January 2008 and no longer has that status. 174a) Wetlands, namely land that is covered with or saturated by waterpermanently or for a significant part of the year;"
174
"This requirement is taken from RED II, Article 29, paragraphs 4 and 5. It is be applied to all perennial crop production, whetherfor biofuels, bioliquids or biomass, or for food or feed uses. The intention is per RED II, namely, to ensure high carbon stock land isnot converted for the purposes for agricultural production."
141
"b) Continuously forested areas, namely land spanning more than onehectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover ofmore than 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ;c) Land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than fivemetres and a canopy cover of between 10 % and 30 %, or treesable to reach those thresholds in situ; 175d) Peatland, unless evidence is provided that the cultivation andharvesting of that raw material does not involve drainage ofpreviously undrained soil."
Methodological notes:For those demonstrating compliance with the essential managementpractices:-
"The essential management practices are described in the tablebelow. All essential practices will need to be deployed, except whereparticular practices can be demonstrated to be not applicable to thatfarm holding given the particular biophysical conditions at that farmholding."
-
"In respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG assessment,this assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevantemissions on the farm associated with production, as well asemissions associated with energy and fuel use (see below forrelevant GHG categories). If it can be demonstrated that no carbonassessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location(either because of language or lack of access to farm advisorysupport), this practice may be omitted in the first instance. Theassessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period.The assessment is a self-assessment using an appropriate tool, noindependent audit or verification of the GHG assessment is required."
-
"To demonstrate compliance with all other essential practices, it willbe necessary to establish a farm sustainability management planwhich describes the management practices being deployed - takinginto account crop husbandry requirements, farm pedo-climaticconditions - and their coverage on the farm. To prepare the farmsustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, orthe plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decision-supporttools."
For those demonstrating compliance with GHG thresholds:
175
"Unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology ofpart C of Annex V of RED II is applied, the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of Article 29 of RED II would be fulfilled."
142
-
"To demonstrate compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds itwill be necessary to establish a Carbon stock and GHG emissionbaseline for the farm (see below for relevant GHG categories). It willbe against such baseline data that emission reductions of Carbonincreases can be measured. A carbon audit is necessary in order toalso assess where action is needed, and this must be accompaniedby a carbon management plan to set out the management practicesthat will deliver the GHG emissions reduction/ carbon sequestration.This carbon management plan is part of the broader farmsustainability plan."
For all users:-
"Calculations of carbon stocks and GHG emissions levels shouldinclude the following, though it is recognised that in practice, thescope of GHG counted will be subject to the technical capabilities ofthe GHG accounting tools being used:o"
CO2 emissions and removals in above ground biomass
o
CO2 emissions and removals in below ground biomass andsoils
o
"N2O emissions from exposed soils, fertiliser application, andthose embedded in fertiliser production and fertiliserapplication"
o
CH4 emissions from livestock (enteric fermentation andmanure management) and some soils (e.g. wetlands)
o
CO2 emissions from fuel and electricity use
-
"Emissions, sinks and management practices are all to be audited at3-year intervals to confirm ongoing compliance with theserequirements."
-
In the case of force majeure: emissions resulting from naturaldisturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement ofthe thresholds and will not affect the application of theserequirements or result in non-compliance with these criteria.

"RationaleOpportunities for substantial mitigation and contributions to a net zero carbon economyAn overarching goal of the Taxonomy is to enable the screening of economic activities to determinewhether or when they do or do not deliver substantial mitigation, consistent with the underlying goal ofa net zero carbon economy by 2050."
"In the context of agriculture, Net-Zero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot bereduced to zero, they can be compensated for through increased removals (through carbonsequestration) on farmed land. The discussion about the scale at which net-zero should (and could) bemet solely in agriculture remains open. It may not be possible to reach net-zero emissions on anindividual farm holding in all cases. In other cases, it may be more feasible. At the aggregate level, itmay be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas, wouldstruggle to reach net-zero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country. This raisesthe question as to the extent to which a given farm, or aggregation of farms, could reach net-zero and"

"the extent to which these farms could appropriate negative emissions (sequestration) from other farmsor other sectors.The criteria proposed in the Taxonomy do not attempt to address this question directly and insteadfocus on ensuring that emissions are reduced and that removals increase at the economic activity(NACE code) level.While livestock production, and in particular ruminant livestock production (beef, lamb, dairy), is asignificant source of emissions in the agriculture sector it is included in the Taxonomy due to thesignificant short-term mitigation potential associated with reducing emissions intensity in livestockmanagement, and in particular long-lived greenhouse gases (N20, CO2), through good practices onthe farm. In the short term, emission reductions associated with improved nitrogen use efficiency andmanure management are substantial, with overall positive impacts on farm level economics. Each ofthese needs to be addressed in order to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantialmitigation and contributes its part to a net zero carbon economy. Doing so ensures each instance oflivestock management maximises its contribution – this rationale drove the principles set out above.However, it is important to note that for absolute emissions from agriculture to continue decreasingbeyond a certain point and to move towards net-zero targets by mid-century, reduced emissionsintensity will need to be coupled as soon as possible with commensurate changes in consumptionpatterns and overall reduced per-capita consumption of livestock products, especially beef, lamb anddairy products. This implies both societal changes in terms of changing diets and reducing food waste,as well as structural transformations in the agricultural sector. Significant and coordinated policy effortswill be required to manage both behavioural changes on the side of consumers and to incentivise andmanage structural change in the agri-food supply chain At this point, the Taxonomy cannot addresssuch shifts, but can only point to significant short-term potential associated with efficiency gains. FutureTaxonomy updates should, however, consider these aspects."
"Approach taken to setting thresholds for livestock productionThere continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds (e.g. gCO2e/ha or gCO2e/ unit of production) for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture. Even if suchinformation existed at the aggregate level, translating this to appropriate thresholds would remainchallenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice implementation.However, setting relative GHG thresholds (i.e. % change in gCO2e/ ha or % change in gCO2e/unit ofproduction) is possible, where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm orproject. Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance, it is arelatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which mightpreviously have been achieved and farm is already delivering significant mitigation. Therefore, isharder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X% reduction inemissions than it is for a form that currently performs relatively poorly. Furthermore, to determinecompliance with such a GHG threshold, GHG accounting at farm level is necessary. But this is not yetmainstream, despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches."
147
"The proposals, therefore, allow for a different approach, namely the demonstration of the deploymentof specific bundles of management practices, practices that are recognised as essential to deliveringlow carbon production in different types of agriculture. This qualitative approach is relatively simple tomonitor, and there are existing mechanisms to do so, such as under the CAP. It also provides a moredirectly communicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices onthe ground. As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices aswell as those that will additional investment finance to do so, it also allows for the recognition of farms(and associated assets and equity) that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG footprint, soavoids the problems associated with the relative GHG threshold as described above.Emission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources: entericfermentation (42.9%; 0.186 GtCO2e); management of agricultural soils (38%; 0.165 GtCO2e); andmanure management (15.4%; 0.067 GtCO2e). And they are predominantly from reductions in non-CO2emissions as these form the majority of agriculture emissions in the EU, with CO2 from on-farm energyuse being a minor component (covering only 0.13% of total EU28+ISL agriculture emissions in 2014).The largest share of the EU’s agricultural non-CO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potentnitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Nitrous oxide accounts for 58% of non-CO2 emissions fromagriculture (largely from fertiliser application and exposed soils, as well as grazing animals), withmethane accounting for the remaining 42% (largely from livestock and rice cultivation). In some cases,GHG emission from energy (traction, heating, cooling, irrigation) can form a significant proportion ofemissions arising from the farm. The proposed best practices therefore include a provision for whenGHG emissions from energy are greater than 20% of farm emissions, these should be reduced by 20%through efficiency and energy source requirements.In relation to livestock management, mitigation potential derives from improved animal health planning,lower-emission feeding strategies, and reducing emissions from manure management and wastetreatment (Buckley et al. 2015179, Chadwick et al 2011180, Miselbrook et al 2014181)."
Metrics and thresholdsOn management practices that deliver substantial mitigationRationale for the selection of practices: Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possiblemitigation activities available in livestock production to address the different emissions and opportunitiesfor sequestration.

"For the purpose of the Taxonomy, individual management practices were identified for which: 1) there issufficient existing scientific knowledge and consensus on the mitigation effects and interactions withother environmental and food security objectives; and 2) the scale, certainty and consistency of mitigationeffects is sufficiently demonstrated (for example, Smith et al. 2008 182, Paustian et al. 2016183, Kay et al.2019184).The identified practices include activities that reduce the carbon intensity of agriculture and do not riskleakage effects, and also do not risk negative ancillary effects or are in conflict with legislation in theEU. These practices deliver substantial mitigation with relatively high certainty across a range ofbiophysical and farming conditions.Scientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories or individual practices andalso indicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads tosubstantial mitigation, i.e. an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which areenvironmentally sustainable should be pursued (Paustian et al. 2016). The literature, however,provides limited guidance on how to translate sectoral or activity-based mitigation potential intoindividual farm-level mitigation potential, i.e. what combination of practices should be applied togetheras a minimum at farm level in different conditions to deliver substantial mitigation. Therefore, TEGexpert input was used to determine the minimum combination of practices which should be appliedtogether for each NACE activity code to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level.The table below indicates the management practices selected as the bundle of essential practices that,deployed collectively, should deliver substantial mitigation from livestock production at farm level. It isnoted that given heterogeneity of farms, deployment of the same bundle of practices may result indifferent emissions impacts farm to farm, but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle willdeliver substantial mitigation in the majority of cases.The applicable area for management practices relates to where those practices could and should bedeployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives. For example, buffer strips designed to prevent soilerosion and run-off are to be placed next to water courses and ditches, etc. Therefore, some practicesmay only be deployed on a small area of the farm where they add value.One best practice, the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reducedemissions or increased sequestration. The rationale for including this practice it to raise awareness ofwhere the main emission sources are on a farm holding, what opportunities exist and thus wheregreatest mitigation impact could be achieved, including through opportunities for carbon sinks, andthereby improve the targeting of mitigation action. In this spirit, no verification or audit of theassessment is required. This is different from the quantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit,both of which are necessary when demonstrating compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds.The assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated"

If it can bedemonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location(either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support), this practice may be omitted inthe first instance. The assessment, however, becomes mandatory within a five year period,"
"On GHG emission reduction thresholdsSubstantial, in the context of substantial mitigation, falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net negative (where removals exceed emissions), net-zero (where removals balance with emissions) tovarying degrees of emission reductions. With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductionsfrom the agriculture sector as a whole or non-perennial crop production specifically the degree to whichemission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need. It isalso noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach, and thus any level of ‘substantial’ should beconsistent in the global context.A review by Wollenberg et al, 2016185 suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between0.9 – 1.4 GtCO2e (in 2030) to meet the 2 °C target, 1 GtCO2e (in 2030). This was selected as anapproximate target. These figures relate primarily to non-CO2 emissions and are “an annualized”, notcumulative, goal. The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 6.15–7.78 GtCO2e yr-1 foragriculture in 2030. The goal represents an 11–18% reduction relative to the scenarios’ respective2030 business as usual baselines”186. As these figures represent non-CO2 emissions they implicitly donot recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals.As such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20% over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 hasbeen proposed as ‘significant contribution’ in the context of the Taxonomy. This is supported by workfrom Frank et al (2018)187, and The IPCC’s fourth assessment report (Smith et al, 2007) 188.In terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture, the work by Wollenberg et al(2016) calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to2100. The emissions curve (level of emissions over time) increases and decreases at different points,relative to existing efforts, projected changes in external factors, etc. The average reduction figureneeded over this whole timeframe is 28% emission reductions compared to the baseline. As we movetowards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases, and this implications forany threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe. The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger(approximately a doubling). Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linearbetween the years, for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20% reduction by"

"2030 and 40% reduction by 2050 as a linear trajectory of emission reductions also simplifiesimplementation and communication.The study determined these reductions against a business as usual scenario for agriculture. However,establishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limit implementationeffectiveness, as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming the mitigation action wasnot in place. For simplicity, the proposed approach is therefore to simplify the requirement to compareemissions at the start of period with those achieved over the specified period and assess this againstthe target reduction.The threshold metric is gCO2e, and not an emissions intensity metric such as gCO2e/ unit ofproduction, as this enables the Taxonomy to be applied by those reducing emissions intensity (e.g.through efficiency improvements) while also requiring them to reduce emissions overall – the overallgoal."
"On setting Carbon stock thresholdsSetting a universal (or global) absolute threshold (in terms of tC/ ha) for carbon stocks is not a viableoption given the variability of carbon sequestration and stocking potential – which is very contextspecific. Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration inline with a universal, absolute threshold. Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions(based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site) is not possible as at present is it isimpractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential (i.e. saturation point) of a specificarea. Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type, and therefore are not trulycontext specific.Furthermore, even defining a specific % of carbon increase required is more challenging than settingthe relative threshold for reducing emissions. Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level ofemissions at a given point, therefore a 20% reduction can be expected to deliver a ‘substantial’contribution from an underperforming farm (resulting in high overall emission reductions). However, thepremise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural land as there is relativelylittle evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock increase would be needed onagricultural land in a 1.5 or 2°C climate stabilisation target scenario, as this is relative to the level ofemissions from that same land (if one is pursuing a net-zero approach) or the level of carbonsequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy. It is however, recognised that Csequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculture sector at globalscale, while emission savings of non-CO2 emissions may be more important in the EU with a prevailingintensive production system. Smith et al (2007) estimate that 89% of the technical potential of emissionreductions in the sector to 2030 and 2050 lies in soil carbon sequestration, i.e.in reducing net CO2emissions from farming practices and management, including cropland management, grazing landmanagement, restoration of cultivated organic soils and restoration of degraded lands."
151
"The proposal therefore is to require evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of increasingcarbon stocks, specifically, the progressive increase of carbon stocks (confirmed at 3-year intervals)over a 20 year period."
On no conversion of high carbon stock landA cut-off date of 2008 for no conversion of high carbon stock land is chosen to be consistent with theoperation of the Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria relative to these land types. Thisprovides a link with existing sustainability schemes through which compliance could be demonstratedfor this criterion.
"On demonstrating compliance with these criteria and thresholds3-year compliance checking is proposed to ensure progress is being made and mitigation is beingdelivered in practice, and also to reduce the burden necessary on operators. This compliance checkingis required for management practice checking, C stock change and GHG reductions.To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used, or the plan canalso be prepared using other nutrient decision-support tools. Advisory support will likely be required inthe process of preparing the plan and may also be required to ensure adequate implementation of theplan..Do no significant harm assessmentThe activity livestock production captures a distinct set of sub-activities that would include intensiveand extensive forms of livestock rearing, as well as the management of permanent grassland.

MANUFACTURING
"Why manufacturing is included in the TaxonomyManufacturing is the second largest contributor to CO2e emissions but is also be able to produce theproducts and technologies that can contribute to GHG emissions reductions in other sectors of theeconomy and is thus a fundamental part of the low-carbon economy.The manufacturing section of the Taxonomy therefore includes both the manufacturing of low-carbontechnologies as well as energy intensive and hard-to-abate manufacturing sectors. It aims to give supportto those economic activities that are low in carbon emissions and first movers who are engaging in atransformational shift.Manufacturing coverage and thresholdsWhich economic activities are included and whyThe economic activities covered include sectors that account for a high share of industrial GHG emissionsas a result of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions related to the manufacture of the products and thereforeoffer large potential for GHG emissions reduction. Specifically, this includes: the manufacturing ofaluminium (NACE 24.42); the manufacturing of iron and steel (NACE 24.1, 24.2, 24.3); the manufacturingof cement (NACE 23.51); and the manufacturing of chemicals (NACE 20.13, 20.14, 20.15, 20.16).Additionally, enabling activities are also included in manufacturing which covers both those activitiesincluded under “low carbon technologies” and also “mitigation measures” which when combined result inachievement of the thresholds."
"Low carbon activities refers to: the manufacturing of products, key components, equipment andmachinery that are essential to a number of key renewable energy technologies (geothermal power,hydropower, concentrated solar power (CSP), solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, wind energy andocean energy); the manufacturing of low-carbon transport vehicles, fleets and vessels; themanufacturing of energy efficiency equipment for buildings and other low-carbon technologies thatresult in substantial GHG emission reductions in further sectors of the economy (including privatehouseholds)."
Mitigation measures are included as enabling activities since they are recognised as critical stepssupporting the transition of economic activities in these high emitting manufacturing sectors towardsreaching the defined thresholds.
"The TEG acknowledges that many manufacturing activities are still not currently covered in theTaxonomy, and this must be addressed. It should be stated, however, that the TEG have not assumedthat omitted activities are non-green or brown. Due to limited time, the TEG has focused its attention onthose economic activities likely to play the biggest role in leading Europe down a low-carbon pathway tomeet its Paris Agreement and 2050 climate neutrality goals. Therefore, the first round of sectors includedin the manufacturing section of the Taxonomy are either those energy intensive and hard-to-abate sectorsthat emit the most greenhouse gas emissions or those enabling manufacturing sectors that are clearlynecessary for Europe’s low-carbon economic transformation. This means that other manufacturingsectors (including other energy-intensive sectors) are not currently included even if they are significant intheir impact.155"
"Criteria, Metrics and ThresholdsThe manufacturing activities addressed in this first draft of the mitigation Taxonomy are considered tomake a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation if the specific thresholds set for each activityare reached (e.g. producing cement with GHG emissions lower than 0.498 tCO2e/t of cement. The criteriafocus instead on reducing the GHG emissions caused by manufacturing activities up to the levels ofperformance achieved by best performers. The criteria cover in general both scope 1 and 2 emissions.Additionally, in a number of sectors, the requirement to limit GHG emissions to the level set in the EUETS benchmarks has been complemented by other thresholds (e.g. on the energy efficiency and carbonintensity of the electricity used) or by alternative qualitative criteria (e.g. making production of recycledaluminium eligible).The EU ETS benchmarks have been the main reference for setting such thresholds, as they correspondto the level of performance achieved by the 10% best installations in the EU and are updated regularly.The platform is recommended to review whether additional requirements could be set for those economicactivities where BAT-Associated Energy Efficiency Levels (BAT-AEELs) exist or are developed over time,based on such levels. The implications of this in terms of global applicability of the Taxonomy will need tobe considered. A regular update is also is needed to assess if alternative low carbon technologies havebecome market ready and commercially available. This may result in alternative threshold criteria foractivities that currently have a threshold based on EU ETS benchmarks.The thresholds for the manufacturing activities are predominantly tied to EU ETS benchmarks. Thatmeans that the thresholds reflect the average performance of the 10% most efficient installations in aparticular sector. EU ETS benchmarks have been selected because they are the most robustbenchmarks available and the data calculated according to the boundaries set are readily available for allinstallations within the EU that are part of the EU ETS scheme. Although performance data using suchmetrics are not necessarily readily available for non-EU installations, the methodologies can be followedand therefore can also be calculated univocally for non-EU installations. Additionally, the EU ETSbenchmarks are periodically updated approximately every 5 years, meaning that the thresholds that referto them will not be static over time but automatically continue to represent the performance of the 10%best performing plants.The TEG recognizes that there are disadvantages to using the EU ETS benchmarks. The benchmarksare based on EU historic trends rather than global data. Moreover, EU ETS benchmarks do not considerthe full lifecycle of a process or product but are focused on scope 1 and/or scope 2 GHG emissions.Therefore, EU ETS benchmarks do not directly support recycling or improvement in upstream emissions.Mindful of these limitations the TEG has actively looked for equally robust data sources but has to datenot been able to identify equally robust data sources. Where equally robust data can be providedthese should be considered by the Platform.There are no explicit thresholds for those manufacturing activities listed under the category “low carbontechnologies”. No criteria on the GHG emissions from manufacturing of listed products are specifiedsince the mitigation benefits of these products, components, equipment and technology are considered tooutweigh the emissions generated as a result of the manufacturing process to generate them. Thisuncomprehensive list is complemented by additional criteria that allow additional products, components,equipment or technologies to be considered eligible if the overall benefits in terms of GHG emissions156"
"reductions are proven by life cycle carbon foot printing. (See low carbon technologies section in tablesbelow).Mitigation measures are eligible for inclusion under manufacturing when expenditures in energyefficiency measures, process improvements and all other mitigation measures in one of the eligiblemanufacturing activities support closing the gap between the current level of efficiency and the levelconsidered ‘substantially contributing to mitigation objectives’ as defined by the thresholds. This has twoimplications for users of the Taxonomy:i."
"For private finance users of the Taxonomy, where revenues from Taxonomy eligible activitiescount, such as equities (the share of a corporation would be considered eligible based on theshare of revenues from Taxonomy-eligible activities): only manufacturing activities complying withthe activity threshold would be considered eligible."
ii.
"For the uses of the Taxonomy where expenditures in Taxonomy-eligible measures count (such asfor financing projects, green mortgages, the use of proceeds from green bonds or simply countinghow much a corporation has invested in climate mitigation): all the investments needed to reachthe activity threshold would be considered eligible. This means that measures are eligible oncethey are implemented entirely and the threshold is reached, as well as if individual investments indifferent measures are implemented over a defined time span as part of an overall investmentplan (e.g. 5 or 10 years) and substantially support the activity achieving the thresholds."
"Application of CCS in the Manufacturing SectorIn the manufacturing sector, certain processes are difficult to reduce to very low carbon levels, particularlyin the metals, minerals and chemical sectors. In those cases, switching to renewable energy sources andenergy efficient measures are not feasible options and very low carbon levels may only be achieved byeither implementing an alternative manufacturing process, like switching to the production of alternativeproducts, or due to the introduction of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which areaddressed in another section of the Taxonomy. Additionally, if CCS enables an economic activity in themanufacturing sector to meet its screening criteria, the installation of CCS technology can be consideredTaxonomy eligible once the screening criteria has been met. This also applies to overall economicactivity. Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU), where the captured CO2 is utilized as a feed stock (e.g. fora chemical process), may also qualify, if substantial mitigation impacts can be demonstrated by reducingemissions towards meeting the activity criteria (e.g. the use of CO 2 for enhanced oil extraction would notqualify).Coherence with other sections of the TaxonomyDue to the nature of manufacturing, and in order to undertake a proper systemic value chain approach inthe Taxonomy, close linkages have been made with the energy, transport, agriculture and buildingsectors. Where possible, circularity considerations (in so far as they affect GHG emissions) and a broadervalue chain approach have been considered. Given the role of the manufacturing sector in supply chains,the future Platform will need to review the thresholds to assess whether changes will be necessary toaccommodate the planned circular economy objectives of the Taxonomy. i.e.it is recommended that atthe point in time when the Platform work to define threshold criteria for meeting substantial circulareconomy contributions the manufacturing thresholds currently defined with regard to mitigation andadaptation objectives are reviewed."

"Stakeholder feedbackIn June 2019 the TEG published its report on EU Taxonomy. 196 The manufacturing group were verypleased to receive the rich and insightful comments which have inform the TEG. It should be noted thatsome sectors submitted their comments collectively through an industry representative where as otherssubmitted similar or identical text multiple times. What follows is an overview of how the TEG subgrouphas worked to respond to the Call for Feedback to get feedback on the publications.1. The most contentious aspect in manufacturing in terms of the highest number of disagreements was inrelation to the list of low carbon technologies list. Most of the submissions, many of them identical, wererequesting additional technologies to be included in the list. These were reviewed and appropriateamendments were made to the list in the light of these comments.2. Stakeholder expressed concerns about the stringency of the thresholds for the manufacture ofhydrogen given the need for green hydrogen to contribute to a 2050 zero future. As a result of feedback,the thresholds were amended.3. There were multiple requests for a life-cycle analysis of steel to be taken into account in thresholdsproposed to acknowledge that steel is a material that can fully be recycled and will continue to play a rolein a low carbon economy. We acknowledge the role that steel may play in the supply chain efficiencies,but for practical reasons have limited the scope of thresholds proposed to the production of primary steeland steel recycling only. At this stage, circular economy criteria for steel are not proposed and need to bedeveloped in a later stage. In this respect, the manufacturing of e.g. aluminium or cement is dealt with ina similar way.4. It was noted that there many of the submission relating to different manufacturing activities, includingcement were not purely of technical nature but were rather presented as a position. The TEG hasworked to ensure that the thresholds applied promote low carbon production.5. There was some considerable concern from stakeholders about the manufacture of plastics,particularly single source plastic production. Many of the submissions recommended a circular economicperspective be introduced. In response, the threshold has become more explicit in limiting eligibility tothose plastic manufactures where at least 90% of the final plastic is not used for single use consumerproducts and is not recycled. This needs to be confirmed needs to be confirmed from science-basedresearch/studies etc."
"Next steps and recommendations1. The TEG recognizes that the scope of the manufacturing section of the Taxonomy should be extendedto cover more manufacturing activities. Care must continue to be taken to review the context in which theTaxonomy is applied to ensure that it does not identify activities as green which have perverse incentivesor a negative impact on other environmental objectives. From a manufacturing perspective, the TEG"
"196 See, https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/sustainable-finance-teg-taxonomy_en."
158
recommends that in the next round the future platform consider building on the work undertaken toestablish thresholds for other manufacturing sectors that include at least in the near-term:
"Further analysis of high polluting activities such as glass manufacturing, paper and pulpmanufacturing, and textiles. The manufacturing processes for these activities are complex, multipleand result in the production of an array of diverse products. The TEG recommends that the futureplatform address these manufacturing sectors, by prioritising those processes that contribute themost significant portion of emissions (e.g. steam generation in the paper and pulp sector) and work toestablish thresholds for these specific processes."
"Mining: this is an important sector both in terms of avoiding bottlenecks in the deployment of lowcarbon technologies by providing the critical materials needed for low-carbon technologies, as well asthe value chain link with energy-intensive manufacturing sectors. Unfortunately, the TEG was not ableto complete work for this sector due to time constraints and the complexity of the issues The TEGrecommends that the platform analyse the role the sector plays in terms of enhancing availability ofthe critical materials needed for current and future technologies to create a climate neutral, circularand resource efficient economy, while sourcing raw materials in a sustainable and responsible way,with a view to consider the enabling potential of the sector. The platform is recommended to ensurethat a life cycle approach is applied when assessing the different phases of the value chain formining is applied. The rational for applying life cycle analysis is that many metals are essential forlow-carbon technologies. For example, Aluminium for lightweight cars; Copper for electrics andmotors in electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines; Battery metals (Cobalt, Lead, Lithium,Manganese, and Nickel) for clean mobility and grid storage batteries; Zinc and Cobalt for protectingoff-shore wind turbines; Silicon in solar panels; Precious metals for clean mobility and solar panels."
"Further analysis for light manufacturing sectors may also need to be considered by the platformas these sectors grow in impact. For these, the platform could either try to develop individual activitycriteria for each (where feasible) or identify key improvement measures applicable across a numberof these sectors and classify them as individual enabling activities."
2. Further criteria under DNSH could be analysed particular in regard to the following issues:
"Red Mud: A waste by product of the process for producing al oxide from the bauxite ore foraluminium, referred to as red mud contains toxic heavy metals and its high alkalinity makes itcorrosive and damaging to soil and life forms, presenting potentially substantial impacts whendisposed. Toxic dumps and settling pools are a feature alongside all bauxite/alumina plantsworldwide, including across Europe, Russia, China, Guinea, Brazil, Jamaica and Australia. The globalaverage of bauxite residue generated per tonne of alumina is between 1 and 1.5 tonnes; it isestimated that over 150 million tonnes of bauxite residue are produced annually – 5-6 million tonnesin Europe alone, and the majority of this waste is being landfilled. The platform is recommended toconsider the impacts of red mud under minimum social and health safeguards and develop anapproach to set up criteria to integrate this within the DNSH environmental impact."
"The platform is recommended to carry out a risk-based assessment on the exposure scenariosfor all chemicals/products/by-products contained in the taxonomy. It is to be noted that otherorganic and inorganic chemicals/products/by-products included in the taxonomy are also potentiallyhazardous to human health and the environment depending upon the exposure scenarios, andtherefore objective, scientifically robust, risk-based assessments should be carried out for all.159"
"Furthermore, the platform should take into consideration the value chain and circular economyaspects of chemicals/products/by-products. For example, Chlorine and PVC are required for theproduction of PVC doors and windows, which are necessary for improved energy efficiency of thebuilding sector. Such value chain and CE considerations would follow a similar logic applied to sodaash in the current version of the Taxonomy, on the basis that it is required for glazing of double andtriple glazed windows.3. The platform is recommended to regularly update the thresholds paying particular attention to:"
Ensuring that the thresholds are updated in the light of EU ETS benchmark revisions.
"Review the thresholds in the light of circular economy objectives and takes into consideration theimpact of applying an additional requirement that for those economic activities where BATAssociated Energy Efficiency Levels (BAT-AEELs) exist, these must also be met. The implications ofthis in terms of global application of the Taxonomy will need to be considered."
4. Explore expansion of low carbon technologies list.
"Further analysis on the inclusion of factories or companies that produce the following technologies.For example, heat pumps, LED lighting, Hot water fittings (e.g. taps, showers) that are rated in the topclass (dark green) of the European Water Label Scheme (http://www.europeanwaterlabel.eu/ ) maybe produced by a factory or company but other things may also be produced."
The TEG recommends that in future the platform consider:o
manufacturing of charging points for electric vehicles.
o
"How and under what conditions to include carbon capture and utilisation (CCU)technologies in different manufacturing sectors, as well as the manufacturing of suchequipment."
5. Enhance existing thresholds to account for different applications of cement.
"The platform is recommended to consider developing specific thresholds for different applications ofcement, e.g. concrete for specific building applications. The focus should be on the substitution ofclinker by binders with a lower content of embedded CO2. Cement is currently produced in manydifferent qualities, which are sometimes used in different applications. As a result exchange betweentwo qualities is not always possible. Therefore, on the way to a climate-neutral economy, it has to bedetermined which types of cement in which application areas can be replaced by those with areduced clinker content, taking into account the availability of clinker substitutes. Within thedecarbonisation of other industries, it may be possible that material flows used today (e.g. fly ash) willno longer be available in the future as a clinker substitute, while the suitability of other materials hasnot yet been proven. The cement types, which are absolutely necessary in a climate-neutraleconomy and cannot be replaced, must be produced in a climate-friendly way. For these types, itthen should be examined to what extent the clinker ratio can be lowered, how energy efficiency canbe increased, how electricity from renewable energies can be used, etc."
6. Consider how to enhance circular economy objectives for the sector.160
"The mitigation thresholds proposed in the taxonomy for manufacturing specifically address thesegment in the supply chain with the highest direct emissions (i.e. the scope 1 and 2 emissionsrelated to the manufacturing of the product). Given the role of the manufacturing sector in supplychains, circular economy objectives are of particular relevance for this sector. Once threshold criteriafor meeting substantial circular economy contributions are being developed, we recommendreviewing these in the context of the mitigation threshold criteria, which address a specific segment ofthe circular economy. For example, improving LCA within the manufacturing sector. For example,LCA consideration of products (steel/aluminium/cement)."
"With regard to both data availability and value chain depth, it is recommended that further care betaken by the platform to address two issues: first, the possibility of looking at data complementary tothe ETS benchmarks; and secondly to ensure that a more complete value chain analysis isundertaken, which will include resource efficiency, in order to match current legislative discussionsaround circularity and critical materials-use, including responsible sourcing"

the (potential) use of toxic substances and generation of toxic wastes (both at themanufacturing stage as well as at other stages of the product/equipment lifecycle); and
"the potential for polluting emissions to air, water and soil from the manufacturing process."

Description
Manufacture of cement
Mitigation criteriaPrinciple
"The manufacturing of cement is associated with significant CO2 emissions.Minimising process emissions through energy efficiency improvements andswitch to alternative fuels, promoting the reduction of the clinker to cementration and the use of alternative clinkers and binders can contribute to themitigation objective.Mitigation measures are eligible provided they are incorporated into a singleinvestment plan within a determined time frame (5 or 10 years) that outlineshow each of the measures in combination with others will in combinationenable the activity to meet the threshold defined below actions."
Threshold
"Thresholds for cement Clinker (A) are applicable to plants that produceclinker only, and do not produce finished cement. All other plants need tomeet the thresholds for cement or alternative binder(A) Cement clinker:Specific emissions (calculated according to the methodology used for EUETS benchmarks) associated to the clinker production processes are lowerthan the value of the related EU-ETS benchmark.As of February 2020, the EU-ETS benchmark value for cement clinkermanufacturing is: 0.766 tCO2e/t of clinker198(B) Cement:Specific emissions associated to the clinker and cement productionprocesses are lower than: 0.498 tCO2e/t of cement or alternative binder 199"
RationaleCement production is responsible for more than 70% of the emissions under C.23 and concrete is themost significant application for the use of cement. Cement is the main constituent of concrete. Thecontent of cement in the concrete and total GHG emissions can vary significantly based on the
"198 Based on the EU ETS benchmark for grey cement clinker (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D0278&from=EN ). The threshold for cement clinker needs to be revised every time thatthere is an update in the EU ETS benchmark value for grey cement clinker.199 Threshold was derived taking into account the threshold for cement clinker and the threshold for clinker to cement ratio. Itexcludes emissions from electricity use that is mainly required for finish grinding, raw materials grinding and the exhaust fans(kiln/raw mill and cement mill)."
167
"specifications of the application that concrete will be used for. For this reason, manufacturing of concrete(Concrete - NACE C.23.6) is not covered by the sustainable Taxonomy.Cement manufacture includes three main stages:1. Raw materials preparation;2. Clinker production;3. Grinding of clinker with other components such as gypsum, fly ash, ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBFS) and fine limestone to produce the finished cement.Typically, 30‑40% of direct CO2 emissions comes from the combustion of fuels; the remaining 60‑70%comes from the chemical reactions involved in converting limestone to calcium oxide 200.Reducing the emissions from the manufacturing process of cement can therefore positively contribute tothe mitigation objective.The absolute performance approach has been proposed in order to identify the maximum acceptablecarbon intensity that the activity should comply with in order to be able to substantially contribute to themitigation objective.ETS product benchmarks have been selected as one of the thresholds for cement clinker production.They reflect the average performance of the 10% most efficient installations in a sector.Within cement manufacture, the following activities were taken into account:1. Process emissions: Emissions from the calcination process for the production of cement clinker2. Fuel emissions: Energy required for the calcination process during the clinker production"
"The cement production facilities that meet the identified threshold are expected to achieve thermalenergy intensity in the range of 2.9 – 3,4 GJ/t clinker."
Threshold calculations:
Cement clinker: Specific emissions: 0.766 tCO2e/t of clinker (EU‑ETS)Clinker to cement ratio: 0.65201Specific emissions: 0.766x0.65 = 0.498 tCO2e/t of cement (or alternative binder)
"Electricity: Indirect emissions from the use of electricity during the clinker and cement productionThe main users of electricity in cement plants are the mills (grinding of cement, milling of raw materials)and the exhaust fans (kiln/raw mill and cement mill, which together account for more than 80% of theelectrical energy usage. The electricity demand in cement plants ranges from 90 to 150 kWh/t cement 202."
"200 https://webstore.iea.org/technology-roadmap-low-carbon-transition-in-the-cement-industry201 As weighted average for the total production of the facility. Global average in 2014 was 0.65. EU around 0.75, and projected to0.65 in 2030202 https://webstore.iea.org/technology-roadmap-low-carbon-transition-in-the-cement-industry"
168
"A global average electric energy demand for cement manufacturing of 104 kWh/t cement was reportedby Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) for the years 2012 to 2014 203. The CSI data cover more than900 plants worldwide, and all technologies and clinker and cement types. The variations in the data aresignificant: The 10% best in class show figures of 85 kWh/t cement and below, while the 90% percentileamounted to 129 kWh/t cement.Taking into account that the decarbonisation of the cement sector will run in parallel with thedecarbonisation of the energy sector, it is expected that the electricity required (as auxiliary power) forcement manufacture in the near future will come from renewable sources and thus a specific thresholdfor specific electricity consumption is not proposed. Based on the above-mentioned information andsources, it is expected that the best in class plants have specific electricity consumption of 85 KWh/ tcement."
"Improving energy efficiency: Thermal energy intensity of clinker and the electric intensity ofcement can be reduced by deploying existing state-of-the-art technologies in new cement plantsand retrofitting existing facilities to improve energy performance levels when economically viable.Switching to alternative fuels: The carbon intensity of cement clinker can be reducedsignificantly by the use of biomass and waste materials as fuels in cement kilns. The clinkerburning process offers good conditions for using different types of waste materials replacingparts of the consumption of carbon-intensive fossil fuels. A wide range of different types ofwastes can be used as fuels but as these can replace primary fuel in cement kilns, a consistentwaste quality is essential (e.g. adequate calorific value, metal, halogen and ash content).Reducing the clinker to cement ratio: Increasing the use of blended materials and the marketdeployment of blended cements is very important for the decarbonisation of the sector andalignment with a low carbon pathway. This requires substitution of cement clinker by mineraladditives such as fly ash, silica fume or blast-furnace slag. The amount of clinker substitute thatcan be blended in the cement depends on the type of substitute and the type of cementproduced. Some mineral additives, e.g. GBFS, allow for substitution levels of over 70 per cent.Revision of the cement and concrete standards, building codes and public procurementregulations would be required in order to allow more widespread use of blended cements withvery high substitution of clinker (e.g. >60%) while ensuring product reliability and durability atfinal application.Alternative clinkers and binders: Alternative clinker formulations (e.g. belite, CSA, BCSA,CACS, MOMS) and alternative binders (e.g. alkali-activated binders) could offer potentialopportunities for CO2 emissions reductions by using different mixes of raw materials oralternatives compared to Portland cement. Their commercial availability and applicability differwidely. Further efforts are required to support the demonstration, testing and earlier stageresearch for alternative clinkers and binders and to develop standards to facilitate marketdeployment. The specification of the benchmark based on ton of binder will allow investments inthese types of novel alternative binders to be considered for eligibility under the EU SustainableTaxonomy.Renewable energy generation and use: Electricity supplied from renewable energy sourcescould be explored as a measure to reduce carbon intensity of the final cement product. This can"

"be achieved through different strategies including implementing renewable-based captive powergeneration, power purchase agreements that ensure electricity imports are provided fromrenewable sources or demand-side response strategies that enable a flexible electricity demand(e.g. a flexible operating strategy of grinding plants throughout the day). Various renewablebased options are available for cement manufacturers including wind power, solar photovoltaicpower, solar thermal power and small hydropower generation. Potential deployment of thesetechnologies in cement plants is highly dependent on local conditions.Transportation emissions: The emissions from transportation are excluded as theserepresent only a small percentage of the total emissions of cement manufacture."

Manufacture of secondary aluminium (i.e. production of aluminiumfrom recycled aluminium) is eligible. No additional mitigation criterianeed to be met.
Rationale-

"Emissions related to the manufacturing of aluminium are primarily related to the use of electricity.Electricity costs contribute to over 50% of the production costs. Consequently, there is a strongincentive for the aluminium industry to aim for improving energy efficiency.The key action for aluminium production to make a substantial contribution to climate changemitigation is to increase its share of use of low carbon electricity. It is acknowledged that on theshort term the availability low carbon electricity may be a limiting factor, depending on the region.This will change in on the medium term, when sufficient low carbon electricity will becomeavailable.The second action for aluminium production to make a substantial contribution to climate changemitigation is to decrease the process’s direct emissions and the emissions due to fuel use foron-site energy productionIt is acknowledged that aluminium production facilities can play an important role in stabilizingelectricity grids by active management of electricity demand. This may result in substantialmitigation contributions, e.g. by limiting the need for electricity storage facilities. However, giventhe lack of available metrics to quantify these impacts, these benefits are not taken into accountat this stage.It is acknowledged that aluminium will play a role in a low carbon economy, in particularenabling light weight products and electrification (including transmission wires). Suchapplications could also be considered eligible under the activity ""Manufacture of other lowcarbon technologies"" provided they can demonstrate substantial emissions reductionsaccording to the criteria for that activity. Furthermore, compared to a number of otherconstruction materials, e.g. steel or plastics, the current process for aluminium manufacturingis easy to decarbonise, i.e. by use of low carbon electricity,All aluminium recycling is considered to make a substantial contribution to climate changemitigation because of its association with much lower emissions than primary production"
The emissions covered are:-
Scope 1: all direct emissions related to the production (the process’s direct emissions and theemissions due to fuel use for on-site energy production).Scope 2: Electricity consumption for electrolysis process and related emissions from thegeneration of the electricity used.

173
The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the manufacture ofaluminium is associated with:
"the potential for significant air emission impacts: perfluorocarbons, fluoride gases, polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and particulate matter (e.g. unused cryolite). Hydrogenfluorides can be toxic to vegetation;the toxic, corrosive and reactive nature of waste generated by the used linings (cathodes) fromthe electrolytic cells (known as spent pot lining (SPL)). Dissolved fluorides and cyanides fromthe SPL material can create significant environmental impacts including groundwatercontamination and pollution of local watercourses;the ability (or lacking thereof) of aluminium manufacturing plants to incorporate aluminiumscrap (including scrap from their own manufacturing processes) in the production process; andthe potential to impact ecosystems as a result of the land footprint of the site and from pollutingemissions."

Measures are in place to minimise and manage waste (including hazardouswaste) and material use in accordance with the BREF for the Non-FerrousMetals Industries.
"In order to avoid risks to circular economy, aluminium manufacturing plantsneed to be able to process aluminium scrap. In order to avoid unnecessaryresource and energy consumption, the aluminium scrap collection andsorting activities should be optimised for separation on an alloy specificbasis. If scrap alloys are mixed, the functionality of the recycled material isrestricted, and valuable alloying elements may be lost.(5) Pollution"

Threshold
"Manufacturing of iron and steel is eligible if the GHG emissions (calculatedaccording to the methodology used for EU-ETS benchmarks) associated tothe production processes are lower than the values of the related EU-ETSbenchmarks.As of February 2020, the EU-ETS benchmarks values for iron and steelmanufacturing are:"
Hot metal = 1.328 tCO2e/t product
Sintered ore = 0.171 tCO2e/t product
Iron casting = 0.325 tCO2e/t product
Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) high alloy steel = 0.352 tCO2e/t product
Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) carbon steel = 0.283 tCO2e/t product
Coke (excluding lignite coke) = 0.286 tCO2e/t product
"All green new steel production, or combination of new and recycled steelproduction, is eligible if the emissions fall below the thresholds above."
176
"Additionally, all production of steel in EAF where at least 90% of the ironcontent in the final products is sourced from scrap steel is considered eligible.In this case, no other thresholds are applicable.’RationaleThe ETS benchmarks are the selected thresholds because of their reliability and the 5-year futureupdate plan. Additionally, they are the only consistent data set available today.The ''Achievable Reference Performance'' specific emissions values, as defined in the standard EN19694-2:2016, are considered to be accessible to any operator under normal operating conditions andtherefore such specific emission values are less strict than the proposed EU ETS benchmarks.Therefore, the EU ETS benchmarks have been selected because they provide an ambitious thresholdunder which the steel and iron making industry should strive to operate in the short-term. However,given that the EU ETS benchmarks are for specific steps of production, the TEG recommends that theSustainable Finance Platform analyses the possibility to define a threshold for the overall integratedsteel plant using the methodology set in the standard EN 19694-2:2016.In the long-term, the steel and iron making industry should aim at implementing breakthroughtechnologies (characterised by ultra-low CO2 emissions). Some of these technologies have alreadybeen demonstrated at the pilot or at industrial scale. Once these technologies become commerciallyavailable, the proposed thresholds will need to be revised in order to reflect the more ambitious specificemission values achievable. These technologies include:"
blast furnace top gas recycling with carbon capture and storage;direct smelting reduction processesdirect reduction with natural gas for production of DRI combined with EAF steelmaking;hydrogen steelmaking in shaft furnaces using H2 produced via water electrolysis (e.g. usingrenewable electricity sources);direct electrolysis of iron ore;
"This activity focuses on the greening of iron and steel manufacturing due to its high contribution toglobal GHG emissions. The potential of greening by products made of iron and steel can be addressedthrough other activities such as “manufacture of other low carbon technologies” where according to thecriteria given for this activity, the manufacturer can prove the overall environmental benefits over thewhole life.Do no significant harm assessmentThe main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from iron and steel production isassociated with:"

Description
Manufacture of hydrogen (CPA: 20.11.11.50)
Mitigation criteriaPrinciple
The manufacturing of hydrogen is a highly carbon-intensive activity within thechemical industry206.Reducing the emissions from the manufacturing activityitself can positively contribute to the mitigation objectives.Hydrogen generated as a process by product of the chlor-alkali production isnot eligible.Mitigation measures are eligible provided they are incorporated into a singleinvestment plan within a determined time frame (5 or 10 years) that outlineshow each of the measures in combination with others will in combinationenable the activity to meet the threshold defined below actions
Threshold
The following thresholds need to be met:
Direct CO2 emissions from manufacturing of hydrogen: 5.8 tCO2e/tHydrogen in alignment with energy thresholds in the taxonomy.
Electricity use for hydrogen produced by electrolysis is at or lowerthan 58 MWh/t Hydrogen 207
"Average carbon intensity of the electricity produced that is used forhydrogen manufacturing is at or below 100 gCO2e/kWh (Taxonomythreshold for electricity production, subject to periodical update)."
"RationaleCurrently, almost 96% of industrially-produced hydrogen is manufactured via steam reforming usingfossil fuels: 48% (natural gas), 30% (liquid hydrocarbon) and 18% (coal). Steam reforming is a matureprocess, associated with high CO2 emissions and incompatible with the EU Strategy for long-term EUgreenhouse gas emissions reductions."

Accounting for approximately 9% of theemissions from the chemical sector. Please note that emissions from the production of methanol and synthesis gas are included inthe 9% share.207 pag 52 of report published by DECHEMA and commissioned by CEFIChttps://dechema.de/dechema_media/Downloads/Positionspapiere/Technology_study_Low_carbon_energy_and_feedstock_for_the_European_chemical_industry-p-20002750.pdf"

"Minimizing the emissions from hydrogen manufacturing, by promoting low carbon emission productionprocesses can positively contribute to the mitigation objective.The selected metrics are (1) emission factors, in terms of GHG emissions per unit of production and interms of electricity consumed as well and (2) an energy efficiency threshold for electricity consumption.The thresholds cover both direct and indirect emissions, to ensure that the most effective abatementtechniques are being incentivized, while avoiding inconsistent incentives, which might promotemanufacturing processes which reduce direct emissions, but which are associated with extremely highindirect emissions.208The thresholds reflect the performance of electrolysis with low carbon energy as defined in theelectricity generation activities, and could also be achieved with CCS. The thresholds proposed arealso in line with current best market practices to certify green hydrogen 209.Do no significant harm assessmentThe main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the manufacture ofhydrogen is, in practical terms, inseparable from the potential for significant harm created by thehydrocarbon refining activity more generally and is associated with:"
"polluting emissions to air (in the case of hydrogen production via electrolysis, there is anindirect environmental impact associated with the generation of electricity);water used for cooling might lead to local resource depletion, dependent of the local scarcity ofwater resources; andthe generation of wastes (e.g. spent catalysts and by-products of the various physical andchemical treatment processes used in purifying the hydrogen produced via hydrocarbonprocessing)."
(2) Adaptation
Refer to the screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation.
(3) Water
"Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or waterconsumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservationmanagement plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders,have been developed and implemented."
"In the EU, fulfil the requirements of EU water legislation."

Mitigation criteriaPrinciple
Reducing the emissions from the manufacturing of carbon black and soda ashand improving energy efficiency and switching to low carbon electricity 210 in themanufacturing of chlorine can positively contribute to the climate changemitigation objective.Mitigation measures are eligible provided they are incorporated into a singleinvestment plan within a determined time frame (5 or 10 years) that outlineshow each of the measures in combination with others will in combination enablethe activity to meet the threshold defined below actions
Threshold
"Manufacturing of carbon black and soda ash are eligible if the GHG emissions(calculated according to the methodology used for EU-ETS benchmarks)associated to the production processes are lower than the values of the relatedEU-ETS benchmarks.As of February 2020, the EU-ETS benchmarks values are:"
For carbon black: 1.954 tCO2e/tFor soda ash: 0.843 tCO2e/t

"Average carbon intensity of the electricity that is used for chlorinemanufacturing is at or below 100 gCO2e/kWh (Taxonomy threshold forelectricity production, subject to periodical update)."
"RationaleThe manufacturing process of carbon black accounts for approximately 3.4% of the GHG emissions fromthe chemical sector, while the manufacturing of soda ash accounts for 1.5% of the emissions. 212The manufacturing process of chlorine is extremely energy-intensive, with chlor-alkali processaccounting for 17% of total electrical consumption of the European chemical and petrochemicalindustry.213Reducing the manufacturing emissions for carbon black and soda ash and improving energy efficiencyin the manufacturing of chlorine can positively contribute to the mitigation objective. Moreover it isrecognised that soda ash used in double glazing can enhance building efficiency gains.The absolute performance approach has been proposed in order to identify the maximum acceptablecarbon intensities of the manufacturing processes of carbon black and soda ash that the activitiesshould comply with in order to be able to substantially contribute to the mitigation objective.For the manufacturing of chlorine, a process that uses electricity to fuel the electrolysis process, theabsolute performance approach has been proposed in order to identify the energy intensity threshold. Inaddition to complying with the energy efficiency threshold, the process shall be based on low carbonelectricity.ETS product benchmarks have been selected as thresholds for the manufacturing of carbon black andsoda ash. They reflect the average performance of the 10% most efficient installations in a sector.Emissions covered:− Scope 1: All direct emissions related to the production (the process direct emissions and theemissions due to fuel use for energy production).− Note on the electricity:According to the methodology to calculate ETS benchmarks, emissions from electricity areconsidered where direct emissions and indirect emissions from electricity are to a certain levelinterchangeable (as is the case for carbon black but not for soda ash).214For chlorine, the value corresponding to an efficient level of electricity consumption was selected as thethreshold given that the main source of energy used for the production of chlorine is electricity and byimproving the energy efficiency of the process, as well as using low carbon electricity sources, theactivity can substantially contribute to the climate change mitigation objective.https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2012:387:0005:0013:EN:PDFhttps://epub.wupperinst.org/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6478/file/6478_Lechtenboehmer.pdf"

Manufacturing of ammonia is eligible if the two following thresholds are met:
Scope 1 emissions lower than 1 tCO2/tAmmonia and
"Combined CO2 emissions (scope 1 emissions and scope 2 emissions, fromelectricity consumed) lower than 1,3 tCO2/tAmmonia."
"For the calculation of the emissions from the manufacturing process of ammonia,both the steps: production of the intermediate product hydrogen and synthesis of theammonia are considered.

"ELECTRICITY, GAS, STEAM AND AIR CONDITIONING SUPPLY"
"Why heat and electricity generation is included in the TaxonomyHeat and electricity generation are responsible for over a quarter of the EU’s greenhouse gasemissions.237 Ambitious emissions reductions in this sector are vital to decarbonisation. The Taxonomywork on the heat and power sector has attempted to recognise this finding by developing suitablyambitious requirements within a model of supporting a transition to the EU’s emission reduction goals.Criteria: Metrics and ThresholdsThis section covers a wide range of activities pertaining to the production, storage and delivery of heatand electrical energy. Technology-agnostic criteria have been developed for different sources ofelectricity and heating and cooling. This section also recognizes the important role that improvements tothe supporting infrastructure associated with delivering both types of energy will play in meeting the EU’snet-zero emissions objective. The TEG has developed these Taxonomy criteria for the energy sector sothey can be used globally.An overarching, technology-agnostic emissions intensity threshold of 100g CO2e / kWh is proposed forelectricity generation, heat production and the co-generation of heat and electricity. This threshold will bereduced every five years in line with political targets set out to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.For electricity and heat generation activities, an ISO 14067 or a GHG Protocol Product Lifecycle Standardcompliant Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) assessment including measurement of fugitive emissions isrequired,. This includes actual physical measurements of methane leakage from the point ofextraction/well-head to production of energy (electricity and/or heat). The TEG acknowledges thatimproved standards and methodologies will develop and recommend that the acceptance of the ISO14067, GHG Protocol Product LIfecycle Standard and the PCF methodologies is reviewed periodicallyreviewed by the platform.To aid the transition to a net-zero economy, certain technologies, such as solar, wind and tidal energy arederogated from the requirement to conduct PCFs assessments on the basis that these technologiescurrently perform significantly below the emissions intensity threshold. These derogations are subject toregular review in accordance with the declining threshold.Furthermore, In the case where CCS is used to meet the emissions intensity threshold, a contractualagreement is required as proof to show that the carbon will be transported and sequestered in economicactivities which are themselves eligible under the taxonomy."
"237 Greenhouse gas emissions by economic activity according to the NACE classification EU-28,2016. Eurostat (env_ac_ainah_r2) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Climate_change__driving_forces#Total_emissions.2C_main_breakdowns_by_source_and_general_drivers."
205
"Method for selecting the emissions intensity thresholdThe EU annual power sector emissions trajectory will need to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, inaccordance with the EU’s Paris Agreement and other climate and energy policy commitments.The calculation of the 100g CO2e / kWh threshold is based on the political targets for future allowedemissions from the power sector, divided by the expected evolution of electricity demand.The threshold will be set at a single value for all new investments in electricity generation, until it isrevised in future. It applies equally to the production of heating / cooling and co-generation of heat andelectricity.For a given investment or activity to be compatible with this trajectory, its average emissions over itsphysical lifetime, or 40 years (whichever is shorter), must be lower than the threshold.The TEG recognizes that complementary emissions reductions activities (such as CCS or direct aircapture with sequestration in a manner consistent with the corresponding EU Environmental LiabilityDirective Annex II page 12), may be attributed to an economic activity’s emissions intensity as subject tothe relevant activity threshold.The threshold was determined as follows:"
Historical power sector emissions and electricity demand data for EU28 are sourced from Eurostat.
"Future emissions are in line with EU political commitments for the ETS sector (-43% by 2030), thenlinearly decline to zero by 2050. Future electricity demand (net generation) is assumed to grow as perthe EU 2016 PRIMES Reference Scenario."
Dividing the projected power sector emissions by the projected electricity demand results in policyconsistent projected annual values for emissions factors of the EU power sector.
A given power generator is considered aligned with these policy targets if its emissions are below theaverage of these annual emissions factors over its lifetime.
"To determine a single technology-neutral threshold covering all technologies, the methodologyconsiders the average annual emissions factors over a period of 40 years 238 from the time ofcommissioning."
"The above calculation results in a threshold that varies by year of commissioning. To avoid updating itannually, and to provide some stability and certainty for investors, the threshold value is fixed for a"
"238 Power plants can have typical lifetimes of between 15 and over 100 years, depending on technology, operating mode andmaintenance profile. 40 years is the maximum period over which the large majority of power plants can reasonably be expected tooperate and emit GHGs without some form of repowering."
206
period of 5 years239 from 2020 and will be revised in 2025. It is set at the minimum value of calculatedannual threshold values over this 5-year period.
"This calculation, rounded to the nearest 5g, results in a threshold value of 100 gCO2e/kWh for thepower sector."
"Although the 100 gCo2e/kWh threshold is derived from power sector assumptions, it will apply equally toboth electricity and heating/cooling generation.During future reviews of the threshold, actual energy sector emissions and generation, as well as longterm projections and policy targets will be updated as necessary."
These criteria imply that:
Unabated natural-gas fired power generation is not expected to meet the required threshold. Gasfired power with carbon capture and sequestration may qualify.
"Blended gas-fired power: Co-combustion of multiple gases for the production of electricity, heat/cooland co-generation is also subject to the emissions intensity threshold. This includes combustion ofRED II gases."
"Hydropower: the embedded emissions associated with the construction of hydropower facilities andthe alteration of landscapes constitute a significant portion of lifecycle analysis emissions. Suchemissions can be compensated for, by a complementary emissions reduction activity as mentionedabove."
"Although the Taxonomy focuses on non-solid fossil fuel and renewable power, the DNSH tomitigation criteria are technology agnostic."
The TEG has also developed criteria for other economic activities across the energy sector including:
Transmission and distribution of electricity
Storage of energy
Retrofit of gas transmission and distribution networks
The manufacture of biofuels and biogas
The operation of district heating and cooling networks
Installation and operation of heat pumps

"The suggested ISO 14044 criteria to be used for LCE assessments seems not being specific enough,and might not providing enough guidance for LCE assessments according to some respondents."
"In addition to the feedback received on the activities covered within the Technical Report for the EUTaxonomy from June 2019, several stakeholders would have liked to see the inclusion or a strongeracknowledgement of nuclear energy, waste-to-energy and unabated natural gas."
"Some feedback implies that more explanation on the rationale on principles, metrics and thresholdwould have been helpful."
OutlookEnergy criteria in the EU Taxonomy will require further refinement and development to ensure topicalityand market coherence. This will encompass:
"Adjustments to thresholds: energy thresholds should be revisited on a five-year basis, in order toreflect state of the art research and progress on decarbonisation efforts. Particularly, the emissionthreshold for electricity generation should be reduced every five years."
Adjustment of DNSH criteria: the criteria should be revisited and adjusted in accordance with thedevelopment of further taxonomy criteria on other environmental objectives and advances inresearch.208
Inclusion of new technologies: technological progress could allow for market entry in the near future.Technologies with a sufficiently high technology readiness level (TRL) could be added to theTaxonomy (e.g. nuclear fusion).
"Development of further metrics: as energy markets decarbonise and deployment patterns of certaintechnologies change, some activities (e.g. storage of electricity) might require the development offurther metrics."
"The TEG also recognises that the use of biomass for energy requires trade-off decisions relative toother potential uses and across mitigation activities, but also for do no significant harm dimensions.For these reasons, the TEG recognises that possible production and use of bioenergy will requirefurther consideration as the Taxonomy is developed and based on technical feedback in the outreachperiod."
"Market impactThe TEG adopted a technology-neutral approach that can ensure rapid decarbonisation within theelectricity sector. Adherence to the declining emissions intensity threshold is technically feasible forvirtually any energy generation technology. However, it does imply that unabated fossil fuel combustion,namely coal and natural gas, will be ineligible under the Taxonomy.TEG deliberations on waste-to-energyOn waste incineration with energy recovery (waste-to-energy, WtE) experts’ opinions differed on whetherthis would be an appropriate environmentally sustainable activity offering a substantial contribution toclimate mitigation. On the one hand, there were arguments against the inclusion of WtE. Thesehighlighted the large portion of waste currently incinerated that could be recycled, the reliance of someindividual Member States on the incineration of municipal waste, and the risk that further increasingcapacities risk overcapacity and could result in lock-in effects. This would in turn discourage more reuseand recycling, options higher in the waste hierarchy that could deliver higher climate mitigation benefits.On the other hand, it was emphasized that WtE has a role to play even in an increasingly circulareconomy, as not all residual waste can be reused or recycled (as acknowledged by the EC in itsCommunication COM(2017)34 on ‘the role of waste-to-energy in the circular economy’, Section 5).According to the political agreement on the Taxonomy Regulation, any activity leading to a significantincrease in the incineration (including WtE) of waste is not considered an eligible activity, as it causesharm to the environmental objective of the circular economy, as per Article 12(d) of the EU Taxonomyregulation, with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste. This exception wasnot part of the Commission’s proposal, which considered any significant increase of incineration capacityharmful to the circular economy and hence ineligible. Therefore, the TEG has not included WtE, butrecommends bringing this matter for further discussion and consideration to the Platform on SustainableFinance, in light of the changes in the political agreement text.TEG deliberations on nuclear energyThe TEG assessed nuclear energy as part of its review on energy generation activities. Nuclear energygeneration has near to zero greenhouse gas emissions in the energy generation phase and can be acontributor to climate mitigation objectives. Consideration of nuclear energy by the TEG from a climatemitigation perspective was therefore warranted.The proposed Taxonomy regulation and thus TEG’s methodology for including activities in the Taxonomyexplicitly includes two equally important aspects, Substantial Contribution to one environmental objective209"
"and Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to the other environmental objectives. In making itsrecommendations, the TEG used evidence and expert opinion from others, but ultimately was mandatedto make recommendations about the inclusion of economic activities and screening criteria in theTaxonomy.Evidence on the potential substantial contribution of nuclear energy to climate mitigation objectives wasextensive and clear. The potential role of nuclear energy in low carbon energy supply is welldocumented.240,241,On potential significant harm to other environmental objectives, including circular economy and wastemanagement, biodiversity, water systems and pollution, the evidence about nuclear energy is complexand more difficult to evaluate in a taxonomy context. Evidence often addresses different aspects of therisks and management practices associated with nuclear energy. Scientific, peer-reviewed evidence ofthe risk of significant harm to pollution and biodiversity objectives arising from the nuclear value chainwas received and considered by the TEG 242,243,244. Evidence regarding advanced risk managementprocedures and regulations to limit harm to environmental objectives was also received. This includedevidence of multiple engineered safeguards, designed to reduce the risks. Despite this evidence, thereare still empirical data gaps on key DNSH issues.For example, regarding the long-term management of High-Level Waste (HLW), there is an internationalconsensus that a safe, long-term technical solution is needed to solve the present unsustainablesituation. A combination of temporary storage plus permanent disposal in geological formation is the mostpromising, with some countries are leading the way in implementing those solutions. Yet nowhere in theworld has a viable, safe and long-term underground repository been established245,246. It was thereforeinfeasible for the TEG to undertake a robust DNSH assessment as no permanent, operational disposalsite for HLW exists yet from which long-term empirical, in-situ data and evidence to inform such anevaluation for nuclear energy."

"Given these limitations, it was not possible for TEG, nor its members, to conclude that the nuclear energyvalue chain does not cause significant harm to other environmental objectives on the time scales inquestion. The TEG has therefore not recommended the inclusion of nuclear energy in the Taxonomy atthis stage. Further, the TEG recommends that more extensive technical work is undertaken on the DNSHaspects of nuclear energy in future and by a group with in-depth technical expertise on nuclear life cycletechnologies and the existing and potential environmental impacts across all objectives.TEG recommendations for further work:The experts identified further economic activities which could be relevant for the Taxonomy. However,constrained by limited manpower, these activities could not be assessed in detail and are for futureconsideration by the Platform. Such economic activities may include:"
"The ownership, operation and recycling of energy storage facilities.Other gas infrastructure, except pipelines, which are relevant to the switch to hydrogen and zerocarbon gases and the recycling of existing gas infrastructure.CCU applications, which ensure CO2 retention,Other eligible energy (electricity, co-gen, heat/cool) assets that can be included for example,production of heat/cool from ocean energy."
"Furthermore, the TEG acknowledges that improved standards and methodologies will develop andrecommend that the acceptance of the ISO 14067, GHG Protocol Product LIfecycle Standard and thePCF methodologies is reviewed periodically reviewed by the platform.Finally, criteria for manufacture of biomass, biogas and biofuels, and use of these fuels in energy andtransport are currently limited to advanced biofuels as per Article 2 (34) of the EU Renewable EnergyDirective II (Directive (EU) 2018/2001). For other types of biofuels that are not advanced biofuels but mayoffer substantial climate mitigation benefits, the TEG request that the Platform undertake further work toconsider establishing criteria for ensuring substantial contribution to climate mitigation.Similarly, the TEG recommends that the Platform undertake further work to consider establishing criteriafor the manufacture of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin as defined byArticle 2 (36) under the Directive (EU) 2018/2001, as this has been included in the Transport criteria ofthe Taxonomy."

Definitions and Notes:
A System is defined as the transmission or distribution network controlarea of the network or system operator(s) where the activity takes place.
"The European System shall be defined as the interconnected electricitysystem covering the interconnected control areas of EU Member States,Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom."
239
"The annual average System grid emissions factor is calculated as thetotal annual emissions from power generation, divided by the total annualnet electricity production in that System."
"The rolling five-year (average) period used in determining compliance withthe thresholds shall be based on historic data, and shall be include theyear for which the most recent data is available."
Transmission Systems may include generation capacity connected tosubordinated Distribution Systems.
Distribution Systems subordinated to a Transmission System that isdeemed to be on a trajectory to full decarbonisation may also be deemedto be on a trajectory to full decarbonisation.
"To determine eligibility, it is possible to consider a System coveringmultiple control areas which are interconnected and with significantenergy exchanges between them. In such a case, the weighted averageemissions factor across all included control areas is used to determineeligibility, and individual subordinated transmission or distribution systemswithin this System will not be required to demonstrate complianceseparately."
"It is possible for a System to become ineligible after having previouslybeen eligible. In Systems that become ineligible, no new T&D activitiesare eligible from that moment onward, until the system is again incompliance with the threshold (except for those activities which arealways eligible, see above). Activities in subordinated Systems may stillbe eligible, if these subordinated Systems meet the criteria of thisTaxonomy."
A direct connection or expansion of an existing direct connection toproduction plants includes infrastructure that is indispensable to carry theassociated electricity from the power generating facility to a substation ornetwork.
"RationaleIncreasing access to electricity will support its decarbonisation by enabling more consumers totransition from carbon-intensive energy supply, while increasing the utilisation of renewable energy.As countries continue to fulfil their decarbonisation objectives, there will be fewer and fewerinvestments in transmission and distribution which are not climate aligned."
"Under this logic, we propose that most investments in electricity transmission and distributioninfrastructure in Systems where a significant majority of new generation capacity is from low carbongeneration sources should be considered climate-aligned under the EU Taxonomy.Do no significant harm assessmentThe impacts of transmission and distribution lines are a function of the spatial alignment of the grid,the structures and conductors required for various voltages, the extent to which pre-existingcorridors are used, and how the transmission and distribution lines are operated and maintained.The most common environmental impacts of electricity transmission and distribution infrastructureare visual, ecosystem and land use. In the cases of underground offshore electricity lines, water andmarine resources may be impacted."

"RationaleElectricity Storage is defined according to article 2.59 of the recast Electricity Directive as: “In theelectricity system, deferring the final use of electricity to a moment later than when it was generated,or the conversion of electrical energy into a form of energy which can be stored, the storing of suchenergy, and the subsequent reconversion of such energy into electrical energy or use as anotherenergy carrier.“Electricity storage can support the integration of renewable energy systems into electricitytransmission and distribution. It can balance centralized and distributed electricity generation, whilealso contributing to energy security.

Thus, the eligibility criteriaare based on existing EU regulation but seek to advance the agenda by setting a higher thresholdon the required GHG emissions savings outlined in RED II and restricting eligibility to advancedbioenergy feedstocks.Do no significant harm assessmentThe key environmental aspects to be taken into account when investing in this activity are theimpact on local water (consumption and sewage), the fulfillment of the applicable waste andrecycling criteria, the SO2, NOx dust and other emissions control in line with BREF/ MediumCombustions Plants Directive and the avoidance of direct impacts on sensitive ecosystems, speciesor habitats.Intelligent pathways for cascading use are environmentally superior and preferable to single use.277."

"WATER, SEWERAGE, WASTE AND REMEDIATION"
"Why is water, sewerage, waste and remediation included in the TaxonomyThe sub-sector Water, Sewerage, Waste and Remediation (WSWR) covering NACE-Codes E36 to E39contributes to a rather small share of the EU’s total greenhouse gas emissions – water with 0.2% andsewerage, waste, remediation with 4.4% in 2016. However, advanced solid waste management has agreat potential to trigger greenhouse gas emission reductions in other sectors of the economy throughwaste prevention, separate waste collection, waste reuse and recycling.What is coveredIn the waste sector, a systems approach describing the climate mitigation effects of an integratedpackage of closely interrelated and combined environmentally sustainable activities would have its merits.As, however, the scope of the Taxonomy subgroup was to define stand-alone activities, the chosenclimate mitigation principles, metrics and thresholds were formulated in a way to allow for the assessmentof singular activities without consideration of their linkages in a complex waste management system(respectively, waste hierarchy).The TEG and the experts involved assessed the NACE codes for WSWR and identified nine economicactivities that offer a substantial contribution for climate mitigation:"
"E36.0.0 Water collection, treatment and supply: 1. Water collection, treatment and supply"
E37.0.0 Sewerage: 2. Centralized wastewater treatment; 3. Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge
E38.1.1 Collection of non-hazardous waste: 4. Separate collection and transport of non-hazardouswaste in source segregated fractions
E38.1.2 Collection of hazardous waste: -
E38.2.1 Treatment and disposal of non-hazardous waste: 5. Anaerobic digestion of bio-waste;6. Composting of bio-waste
E38.2.2 Treatment and disposal of hazardous waste: -
E38.3.1 Dismantling of wrecks: -
E38.3.2 Recovery of sorted materials: 7. Material recovery from non-hazardous waste
E39.0.0 Remediation activities: 8. Landfill gas capture and utilization; 9. Carbon Capture and Storage
"NACE Codes ‘E38.1.2 collection of hazardous waste’, ‘E38.2.2 treatment and disposal of hazardouswaste’ and ‘E38.3.1 dismantling of wrecks’ (e.g. automobiles, ships, etc.) were found to be of lessrelevance from a climate mitigation perspective and thus reprioritized for later consideration by thePlatform on Sustainable Finance (see section on ‘next steps’ further below)."
287
"On waste incineration with energy recovery (waste-to-energy, WtE) experts’ opinions differed on whetherthis would be an appropriate environmentally sustainable activity offering a substantial contribution toclimate mitigation. On the one hand, there were arguments against the inclusion of WtE. Thesehighlighted the large portion of waste currently incinerated that could be recycled, the reliance of someindividual Member States on the incineration of municipal waste, and the risk that further increasingcapacities risk overcapacity and could result in lock-in effects. This would in turn discourage more reuseand recycling, options higher in the waste hierarchy and that can deliver higher climate mitigationbenefits. On the other hand, it was emphasized that WtE has a role to play even in an increasinglycircular economy as not all residual waste can be reused or recycled (as acknowledged by the EC in itsCommunication COM(2017)34 on ‘the role of waste-to-energy in the circular economy’, Section 5).According to the political agreement on the Taxonomy Regulation, any activity leading to a significantincrease in the incineration, including WtE, of waste is not considered an eligible activity as it causesharm to the environmental objectives of the circular economy as per Article 12(d) of the EU Taxonomyregulation, with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste. This exception wasnot part of the Commission’s proposal, which considered any significant increase of incineration capacityharmful to the circular economy and hence ineligible. Therefore, the TEG has not included WtE, butrecommends bringing this matter for further discussion and consideration to the Platform on SustainableFinance, in light of the changes in the political agreement text.TEG Call for Public Feedback on its Report on EU Taxonomy, June 2019The main issues raised in the public feedback on activities in the subsector WSWR related to broadeningthe scope of some activities: For ‘anaerobic digestion of bio-waste’, and similar for ‘anaerobic digestion ofsewage sludge’ and ‘landfill gas capture and utilization’, respondents suggested to allow for additionaluses of the produced biogas or landfill gas. For the ‘anaerobic digestion of bio-waste’, respondentswarned against the exclusion of certain crops and against the exclusion of blending of feedstocks. Bothissues are reflected in the revised criteria.Setting criteria and thresholdsAn important characteristic of subsector WSWR is that for the identified activities – with the exception of‘water collection, treatment and supply’ – the climate mitigation effect is an inherent result of keycharacteristic of the corresponding business model, for example the energetic utilization of bio-gasproduced through the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and bio-waste, or the material recovery fromwaste for reuse or recycling in other sectors. Hence, the choice of climate mitigation criteria mainlyfocuses on (qualitative) metrics that seek to securing the execution of the activities/businessesthemselves.Only in ‘water collection, treatment and supply’ – namely water supply – the climate mitigation effect is theresult of a more efficient design of the production process (e.g. by raising pump efficiency or reducingleakages). Consequently, concrete quantitative thresholds were defined, with a first option describing anambitious level of high energy efficiency in the water collection, treatment and supply system, and with asecond option setting thresholds for the substantial improvement of the system’s energy efficiency.Given the heterogeneity of WSWR, it is challenging to establish a set of one size fits all criteria. This pointwas raised in the public consultation feedback. However, it is the view of the TEG that these criteria –even if some are referencing to EU regulation – are globally relevant for the contribution of WSWR to a"

"low carbon economy and with the in-built flexibility on options for demonstrating compliance, they can beapplied globally.Impact of these proposalsThe activities do not impose major additional implementation costs on the stakeholders because (asexplained) for most of them – except ‘water collection, treatment and supply’ – the climate mitigationeffects are an inherent result of key characteristics of the correspondent business models and thusshould come along without significant further cost. Considering ‘water collection, treatment and supply’,additional investments may be necessary in order to reach certain thresholds, however the correspondingcosts may partially be equalized by cost savings from higher energy efficiency.There should be no systematic distortive effect of the activities on the number and competitive position ofthe companies in the corresponding sectors. The overall sectoral technological impact will depend on thestate of the water, wastewater and waste management in each Member State in terms of e.g. regionalcoverage of different management technologies. Outside of the EU the technological impact could beeven greater if the state of the sector in an individual country or region is below that of the EU.Clear additional beneficial environmental effects can be assumed for e.g. water, circular economy andpollution. Employment effects should be positive, and further beneficial economic impacts are inducedthrough increased investments and the demand for consumer goods.Why carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is included in the TaxonomyCarbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a key technology for the decarbonisation of Europe. It isincluded in all pathways presented by the European Commission in its Long-Term Strategic Visiondocument and is relied upon heavily in three-out-of-four scenarios outlined by the IPCC in the SpecialReport on 1.5 Degrees.A typical CCS chain consists of three main stages: capture, transport and storage. CO 2 transport andstorage are established and proven processes, with decades of operation and well-established regulationhere in Europe.The Technical Expert Group has developed criteria to define the eligibility of facilities used to capture carbondioxide directly from the atmosphere and, separately, to capture carbon dioxide directly from anthropogenicactivities.CCS can be eligible in any sector/activity if it enables that primary activity to operate in compliance with thethreshold - for example, steel, cement or electricity production."
Capture
"CCS facilitates the direct mitigation of both fossil and process emissions in many industrial sectors includingsteel, cement and chemicals. Time is a crucial factor: the later options for deep decarbonisation in anindustry arise, the more costly they become, and the more likely the need for greater carbon dioxide removal"
289
"(CDR) in the future. 2050 is only one investment cycle away for many industries. Thus, decisions need tobe made today.In addition to renewable energies, energy storage and demand-side management, CCS on dispatchablegeneration allows all aspects of the electricity supply system to be deeply decarbonised.284 CCS providesa backstop to the unabated operation of flexible electricity generation plants that are required to guaranteethe operation and supply of year-round electricity. This is especially true in more isolated grids with a highpenetration of seasonally variable renewables (e.g. onshore and offshore wind) where the reliable operationof electricity networks requires on-demand electricity generation.The availability of CCS means that no remaining segment of the electricity supply system will be capableof emitting CO2 to the atmosphere.Whilst some CO2 capture technologies can incur an ‘energy penalty’ of 10-15%, others do not. For example,the Allam cycle being developed by Net Power on natural gas combustion for power generation does notincur an energy penalty, as supercritical CO2 is integrated fully into the power cycle as a coolant. Thissignificantly reduces both energy and water demand. It is therefore inaccurate to say that CCS is a highlyenergy-intensive technology.Transport and StorageThe transport and storage of CO2 should be considered essential to the infrastructure of a modern,sustainable society. It can aid electricity grid expansion, the integration of renewables and the deepdecarbonisation of energy intensive industries; support and enable CO2 removal; and help stimulate a greenhydrogen market. Without CO2 transport and storage infrastructure, Europe will not achieve its climateobjectives.Chemically, CO2 bonds with surrounding minerals after injection (gradual re-fossilisation), making CO2storage sites safer as time progresses. The IPCC estimates that over 99.9% of CO 2 will remainunderground. The EU has provided clear and extensive assessment and monitoring requirementsthrough the 2009 CO2 Storage Directive. CO2 has already been safely stored in geological formations inEurope for over 20 years."

However,constrained by limited manpower, these activities could not be assessed in detail and are for futureconsideration by the Platform. Such economic activities may include:"
water management activities dealing with the separate management of rain water (e.g. through localinfiltration or separate sewers);

"RationaleAnaerobic digestion (AD) is a process by which microorganisms decompose biodegradable materialin the absence of oxygen. As part of an integrated waste management system, AD is a valid routeto divert biodegradable waste from landfilling and thus reduce the uncontrolled emissions of landfillgas, in particular methane. The AD process produces methane-rich biogas under controlledconditions, and a sludge-like or liquid residue, termed ‘digestate’. Biogas can be used in multipleforms and applications that displace fossil fuels.The digestate is typically used on farmland as organic fertilizer, directly or after a composting step.The use of digestate instead of synthetic fertilizers derived from by-products of the petroleumindustry saves energy and reduces the consumption of fossil fuels. Where there is no immediateuse on farmland, the digestate can be dewatered and ‘cured’ by composting to stabilise thematerial, which can be stored for longer time and used as an organic fertiliser or soil improver.For the treatment of kitchen and food waste as well as other similar bio-waste, AD exhibits the bestenvironmental and climate change mitigation performance compared to other forms of biologicaltreatment and should therefore be given preference where it is technically and economically viable.This depends on several local conditions. 304On the other hand, biodegradable garden and park wastes and other bio-waste with high ligneouscontent are typically not directly degradable by AD. Where such bio-waste fraction is significant, itshould be collected separately and treated by composting (see Taxonomy Activity “Composting ofbio-waste”).Co-digestion of bio-wastes with solid or liquid manure and other agricultural residues as well asenergy crops is sometimes practised to improve the stability of the AD process and increase biogasyields and is eligible under the conditions mentioned in the metrics. Due care needs to be takenhowever to ensure that the use of the digestate (or composts produced therefrom) as a fertilizer/soilconditioner is not negatively affected by such practice.Methane leakage may offset the climate mitigation benefits and therefore needs to be avoided.Specific monitoring is therefore needed to detect methane leakages from relevant facilities.

TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE
"Why transport is included in the TaxonomyTo achieve climate neutrality, a 90% reduction in transport emissions is needed by 2050 (compared to1990). Road, rail, aviation, and waterborne transport will all have to contribute to the reduction321.Currently transport operations consume one-third of all energy in the EU. The bulk of this energy comesfrom oil. This means that transport is responsible for a large share of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissionsand is a major contributor to climate change. While most other economic sectors, such as industry, havereduced their emissions since 1990, those from transport have risen (see Figure 1). Preliminary estimatesfrom EU Member States show that GHG emissions from transport were 29% above 1990 levels in 2018322They now account for more than one quarter of the EU’s total greenhouse gas emissions. This presents amajor challenge in addressing transport sector emissions to ensure that the EU’s emission reductiontarget is met. Although vehicle efficiency improvements have had a mitigating effect on GHG emissions,growing transport demand323 and a sluggish share of low-carbon solutions have outweighed it."

"Within the transport sector, road transport is the dominant emissions source, accounting for more thantwo-thirds (71.7%324) of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars and vans areresponsible for the bulk of these emissions, the rest resulting from trucks and buses. Road transport isfollowed by shipping and aviation as the second and third largest sources of GHG emissions fromtransport.The transport sector represents about 30% of additional annual investment needs for sustainabledevelopment in the Union.325Subjects coveredTo make a substantial contribution to climate mitigation, the activities and technical screening criteria(hereafter ‘criteria’) included in the Taxonomy need to focus on the main emissions sources from thetransport sector. Reducing the GHG emissions from road transport is therefore key. For road vehiclesthere is a well-developed legislative framework in the EU that includes mandatory emissions testing. Thissystem is most mature for cars and vans. It has recently evolved significantly for trucks, and buses are setto follow.Rail and inland waterways are also important emissions sources covered by the Taxonomy. Compared toroad and air, they can provide modal shift benefits. However, EU legislation provides less directorientation regarding these modes of transport.While public transport and the infrastructure for low-carbon transport in themselves are smaller sources ofGHG emissions, they are vital to achieve systemic change towards more sustainable mobility and aretherefore also included in the Taxonomy.ScopeThe transport section of the climate mitigation Taxonomy deals primarily with climate mitigation activitiesregarding operations of vehicle/vessel fleets and the associated enabling infrastructure. The taxonomycriteria for the manufacturing of vehicles and vessels are addressed in Manufacturing and are based onthe criteria in this section.There are several principal options 326 for climate mitigation in the transport sector including:"
"Increasing the number of low- and zero emission vehicles, improving vehicle efficiency andinfrastructure"

Increasing substitution of fossil fuels with sustainable alternative and net-zero carbon fuels327
Improving efficiency of the overall transport/mobility system
"Setting criteria and thresholdsThe general Taxonomy approach for the transport section was based on the agreed taxonomy regulationtext328 and was inspired by the long-term strategic options for decarbonisation of the transport sector asper the Commission’s long-term strategic vision ‘A Clean Planet for All’.329 The associated criteriaproposed has been grouped into three categories below, as identified in the Long Term Strategy. 330Criteria developed for fleet efficiency and fuel substitution have been designed to be discrete, and refer torelevant EU legislation331. For fleet efficiency criteria, tank-to-wheel criteria have been used since thebasis for criteria is the Clean Vehicles Directive, the post-2020 CO2 Regulation for cars and vans and theHeavy Duty CO2 regulation. Life-cycle and well-to-wheel considerations for thresholds is pending on thepossibility to develop and agree a common Union methodology in future as per the above mentionedlegislations.Efficient, low- and zero direct emissions fleetsThis category of criteria requires that operated fleets to become more efficient over time by linkingeligibility to emissions performance below a certain threshold set to ensure substantially reducedemissions. Thresholds are based on performance metrics (vehicle km, passenger km or tonne km). Theyare mode specific and are linked to available testing methods where available. They require efficiencyimprovements without being technology prescriptive, so long as the benefits of relevant technologies canbe demonstrated.The operation of vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions, or close to zero tailpipe emissions, is automaticallyeligible in the proposed criteria. Vehicle/vessel electrification is the main category in this context. Thisapproach is also motivated by ETS inclusion and the ongoing decarbonisation of the EU power sector."

It isacknowledged that for other regions the criteria proposed may not be applicable in defining substantial contributions to climatechange mitigation.331 There is no intention on the part of the TEG to undermine the approach in existing regulations covering these different aspects"
323
"Fuel substitution to net-zero carbon fuelsThe operation of vehicle fleets where fossil fuels are substituted with low- or net-zero carbon fuels suchas advanced bio- and synthetic fuels can make a substantial contribution to CO 2 net emissions savings inthe transport sector by enhancing climate neutral mobility. 332 333,334,335,336,337.In the technical criteria below, the TEG considers a role for low- or net-zero carbon fuels in four activitieswhere they can offer substantial mitigation benefits, and where commercialisation of zero tailpipeemissions vehicles or vessels is limited to date and where the operating conditions for the vehicles orvessels may slow the implementation of zero direct emissions alternatives, including freight transportservices by road; interurban scheduled road transport services of passengers; inland passenger watertransport; inland freight water transport. The ‘Clean Planet for All’ states that a variety of fuels andpowertrains are likely to be needed for long haul heavy goods vehicles and long distance coaches.Furthermore, the Communication from the Commission on the European Green Deal sets out the need toto ramp up the production and deployment of sustainable alternative transport fuels. In this context, theCommission has committed to consider legislative options to boost the production and uptake ofsustainable alternative fuels for the different transport modes. As the taxonomy is developed in future tocover other activities, sustainable alternative fuels (such as advanced biofuels and electro-fuels producedusing renewable energy) may also have a role to play e.g. in aviation and maritime shipping.The proposed criteria limit their eligibility for use in certain modes and for dedicated fleets, where it isunderstood that these fuels and the finance needed to support a shift can have a greater role to play froma climate mitigation perspective through the substitution of fossil fuels. In addition, it is noted in ‘A CleanPlanet for All’ that land constraints imply that biofuels and biomethane should be deployed only in thosetransport modes or means where they are necessary. TEG notes that it’s important to ensure that thesefuels are solely used to realise the maximum benefits of fuel substitution. As such, the criteria proposedalso require a strict monitoring regime to ensure that these particular fuels are used. However, it is notedthat blended fuels with very high levels of sustainable alternative fuels (such as advanced biofuels andelectro-fuels produced using renewable energy) biofuels may also offer climate mitigation benefits, andcould be considered by the Platform in future, particularly in respect to aviation and shipping.As an example of how this might work in practice, a road freight transport operator may seek to operate anew or existing fleet of trucks solely using an eligible fuel (e.g. advanced fuel). To meet the Taxonomycriteria, the operator would need to demonstrate through ongoing verification that the fleet was solely"
"332 Taxonomy regulation Article 6.1.c: https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/41897/st14970-ad01-en19.pdf333 The CO2 emissions from the use of biofuels are not counted in the total GHG emissions from the transport sector in EU’sofficial GHG inventory under the UNFCCC. Without fuel substitution - the CO2 emissions from the transport sector would have beensubstantially higher.(Annual European Union greenhouse gas inventory 1990-2017 and inventory report 2019, EEA, 2019).334 '”A Clean Planet for All”.

"using biofuels as specified in the criteria. A financier may be able to claim its investment (e.g. in a newfleet) was Taxonomy eligible through a contractual agreement with an operator to solely use biofuels, alsoestablishing a verification system to enable ongoing monitoring.Improving the efficiency of the transport system - modal shiftAn important contribution to meeting GHG targets and reducing environmental pressures from thetransport sector could come from a modal shift from aviation and road transport to rail and non-motorisedpassenger transport, as well as from road to rail and waterborne freight transport. However, ‘modal shift’is not included as a distinct economic activity with associated criteria in the proposed Taxonomy due tothe complexities of capturing it in a robust, unambiguous manner within the given Taxonomy architecture.Instead, the proposed Taxonomy acknowledges the potential carbon savings from a modal shift338 andtherefore sets similar thresholds across modes, which indirectly promotes modal shifts (e.g. a greaterproportion of fleets in lower carbon modes are Taxonomy eligible, facilitating investment in theseactivities). The relative emissions performance of modes will change over time as technologies evolveand uptake increases, therefore the approach taken within the Taxonomy should be reviewed in thefuture.Stakeholder feedbackThe feedback received on TEG’s report from June 2019 with regard to the transport sector was in generalpolarized with groups of respondents often advocating for technical criteria at opposite ends of thespectrum. After careful consideration of all feedback no major revisions were made of the proposedsubstantial contribution criteria, although criteria and rationales have been fine-tuned and further clarifiedwhere deemed necessary. Feedback on DNSH criteria have been received for most modes of transportand has led to refinement and clarifications across the board.International applicabilityThe scope of economic activities and the type of criteria proposed in this section may help to inform thedesign of technical criteria for the transport sector beyond the EU. However, the quantitative thresholdsproposed are EU focused by design given the EU taxonomy regulation itself, but also because they arebased on EU legal reference points.Guidance on Ex-Ante AssessmentsDetailed guidance should be established to assist in interpretation and implementation of the taxonomy.For transport, specific guidance will be required for how to undertake ex-ante assessments on utilisationof transport, for example to establish if passenger-km or tonne-km criteria are met. The following is aproposed guidance on methods for undertaking such assessments and are presented in order ofpreference because the likely accuracy of resulting data:a) Demand forecasts and a reasoned analysis of the relation between capacity offered and demand;"

"b) In case there is no modelling available actual load factor data from comparable operations shouldbe used (for example actual data from fleets that are replaced by new fleets);c) Local, regional or national benchmarks could be used as reference, where it provides a very cleardemonstration of meeting thresholdsNext steps and recommendationsAt this stage, there are other activities in the transport sector that have not been addressed, but whichneed consideration as part of further work on the Taxonomy, e.g. by the Platform on Sustainable Finance.These include:"
Maritime shipping (including reference to EU MRV regime)
Aviation
ICT for transport
Energy efficiency improvements in equipment and infrastructure (e.g. in ports)
"Research, development & innovation related activities having the potential to substantiallydecarbonize the transport sector"
Identifying or developing standardised methodologies and guidance for addressing the metric of thecriteria where those are not yet specified
Explore life-cycle considerations for criteria relating to fleets once EU-agreed methods have beendeveloped and agreed
Consider development of criteria for infrastructure in future that take account of embedded carbonemissions in construction materials
"Criteria for manufacture of biomass, biogas and biofuels, and use of these fuels in transport arecurrently limited to advanced biofuels as per Article 2 (34) of the EU Renewable Energy Directive II(Directive (EU) 2018/2001),. For other types of biofuels that are not advanced biofuels but may offersubstantial climate mitigation benefits, the TEG request that the Platform undertake further work toconsider establishing criteria for ensuring substantial contribution to climate mitigation."
"Maritime shipping has been considered by the TEG. Whilst it was evident that zero direct emissions fleetsshould be eligible as for other modes, criteria will also need to be established for short sea shippingwhere modal shift benefits can be achieved. Furthermore, it will be also important to consider approachesto maritime shipping based on the efficiency of transport fleets. Discussions in this area were notconcluded during the timeframe of the TEG and should be continued in further work on the Taxonomy.Aviation was not considered within the scope of the work of the TEG but should be addressed in thefuture considering the significance of emissions from the sector. In addition, ICT transport specificsolutions and transport demand management can be important measures for enabling mitigation thathave not been included at this stage but warrant further study.For a number of criteria, a review period is recommended as detailed in the tables that follow.326"

Zero direct emissions trains are eligible.Other trains are eligible if direct emissions (TTW) are below 50g CO2eemissions per passenger kilometre (gCO2e/pkm) until 2025 (noneligible thereafter)
"Brief rationale:Zero direct emissions rail (e.g. electric, hydrogen) is eligible because:"
"With the present energy mix, the overall emissions associated with zerodirect emissions rail transport (i.e. electric or hydrogen) are among thelowest compared with other transport modes.The generation of the energy carriers used by zero direct emissionstransport is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future"
"The threshold of 50 gCO2e/pkm until 2025 ensures that the carbon intensityremains similar to criteria for eligible road vehicles with low occupation factor(50 gCO2/vkm) and significantly lower than emissions for an average car in thecurrent vehicle stock.RationaleZero direct emissions rail (e.g. electric, hydrogen) is eligible because:"
"With the present energy mix, the overall emissions associated with zero direct emissions railtransport (i.e. electric or hydrogen) are among the lowest compared with other transportmodes.The generation of the energy carriers used by zero direct emissions transport is assumed tobecome low or zero carbon in the near future"

327
"emissions for an average car in the current vehicle stock (290 gCO 2 /vkm339). This means that (diesel)passenger rail transport emission activities will only be eligible when the carbon intensity of the vehicledivided by the number of actual passengers is similar to eligible low carbon road transport vehicles(activity 24.5). The criteria is based on actual ridership (passenger-km) and not capacity offered (seatkm or places-km). This should be justified through real monitoring data from operations or ex-antedemand assessments. The current average for EU diesel rail is 70-90 g CO2 /pkm340, so the thresholdis stringent enough to screen out most of the rail systems based on diesel operating in Europe as theload factor would need to be higher than 60% to reach eligibility. However, it would still enable certainhybrid systems of high efficiency to be eligible.Do no significant harm assessmentThe main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the operation of railtransport activities are attributed to air pollution, noise and vibration, water use.. Direct emissions of airpollutants are not an issue of concern in the case of electrified rail, but only where (very efficient) dieselor hybrid engines would meet the CO2e-threshold defined to ensure substantial mitigation of GHGemissions.(2) Adaptation"

Non-electrified rail infrastructure with an existing plan for electrification oruse of alternatively powered trains.For all cases:"
Only infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation of the transportservice is eligible.Infrastructure that is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or blendedfossil fuels is not eligible
Brief RationaleThe construction and operation of infrastructure for low carbon land transport isconsidered eligible because this is considered a key enabling factor for improving335
"the uptake of the transport activities that are considered eligible under the rest ofthe land transport section of the Taxonomy. Eligibility for infrastructure is linked toeligibility criteria for fleets using the infrastructure, with additional criteria relating tozero carbon transport (active mobility)RationaleThe construction and operation of infrastructure for low carbon land transport is considered eligiblebecause this is considered a key enabling factor for improving the uptake of the transport activitiesthat are considered eligible under the rest of the land transport section of the Taxonomy.Criteria 3. above would accommodate all electric rail lines and non-electrified lines with batterypowered and hydrogen trains operating. However even if non-electrified, there might be a case forrenewal of rail infrastructure in order to ensure continuity of the service while alternative poweredtrains (hydrogen, battery) are deployed in the future years, hence the inclusion of criteria 4 above.There is no significant risk of lock-in in those cases where the fleet is due for renewal.In criteria 3 above, “predominantly used for” should be interpreted to mean that the majority of theuse of the infrastructure is by fleets meeting the substantial contribution criteria in other landtransport activities identified in the taxonomy. Where there may be greater uncertainty in fleet usee.g. estimations based on future projections, a more conservative approach should be applied toensure that the predominant use requirement will be met.There is requirement that only infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation of the transportservice is eligible. Infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation are those infrastructure that areneeded to ensure the day-to-day delivery of a transport service e.g. tracks, IT equipment ensuringservice delivery, ticket offices and fleet maintenance facilities. It does not include ancillaryinfrastructure that do not directly ensure delivery of the operation of the fleet e.g. head offices of thetransport operator.For the criteria that “infrastructure that is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or blended fossilfuels is not eligible”, the term “dedicated” is defined as infrastructure being built and acquired withthe explicit intention to transport or store fossil fuels, even if actual use may serve other purposes aswell.It is acknowledged that embedded carbon emissions in infrastructure projects (e.g. upstreamemissions from manufacture of construction materials) may be significant in certain circumstances.The level of uncertainty around data in this respect makes it challenging at this time to incorporatethis consideration within thresholds for infrastructure. However, this element should be consideredfor ongoing work on the Taxonomy. Transport of fossil fuels is considered to have potential negativeimpacts on climate change and therefore is excluded.ICT infrastructure meeting the criteria above is eligible i.e. it meets one of the stated criteria and isfundamental to the operation of the transport service. However it is recognised that wider ICTactivities in transport may have substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and this willrequire future work to define criteria.Do no significant harm assessmentThe main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from infrastructure activitiesare attributed to noise and vibration pollution, water contamination, waste generation and impactson biodiversity (habitat and wildlife) and land use consumption with ecosystem impacts specifically:336"
"Contamination of water during construction and unsustainable use of water duringconstruction and operationsUnsustainable use of resources during constructions, e.g. generation of high amount ofwaste, no recycling/reuse of construction wasteNoise pollution can be relevant for both rolling stock and railway infrastructure as noisecan be generated by both rolling stock and poor conditions of rail tracks.353Construction of infrastructure can cause significant harm when taking place in protectedareas or areas of high biodiversity values outside protected areas.Infrastructure can cause fragmentation and degradation of the natural and urbanlandscape due to the “barrier” effects of the infrastructure and can involve risks ofwildlife accidents caused by collisions. Railway infrastructure (in particular tunnels) cancause change and degradation of hydromorphological conditions of water bodies andtherefore have impacts on aquatic ecosystems."

"The revised Directive includes ambitious and binding procurement targets for each EU member stateusing harmonized definition what a clean-vehicle is. The notion of clean-vehicle is principally alignedwith aim of the Taxonomy and the proposed Art 6.1.c (above). The transition element is also built intothe CVD.The relevant definitions for light duty vehicles are aligned with the post-2020 CO2 Regulation for carsand vans. Taken together, these two pieces of EU legislation reflect the latest thinking on ambitiousand sufficiently mature performance metrics. The potential for synergies is significant when theTaxonomy is aligned to the legislative thresholds for clean vehicles. It will reduce market uncertainty interms of what are green vehicles to manufacture and operate- both from the demand and supply side.Life-cycle and well-to-wheel considerations for thresholds is pending on the feasibility to develop andagree a common Union methodology:The Clean Vehicles Directive acknowledges that life-cycle and well-to-wheel emission are to beaddressed at a later point in time (recital 31): The possible reflection of life cycle CO 2 emissions and ofwell-to-wheel CO2 emissions of vehicles for the period after 2030 should be considered taking intoaccount relevant provisions of Union law for their calculation at that point in time.By 31 December 2027, the Commission should review the implementation of Directive 2009/33/EC. Inits review the Commission should also assess, inter alia, the possibility of aligning this Clean VehiclesDirective to any methodology for counting life-cycle CO2 emissions and well-to-wheel CO2 emissionsdeveloped in the context of EU vehicle CO2 emission performance standards.The new CO2 Regulation for cars and vans (EU) 2019/631 mandates in Art. 7 (10) that:The Commission shall no later than 2023 evaluate the possibility of developing a common Unionmethodology for the assessment and the consistent data reporting of the full life-cycle CO2 emissionsof light duty vehicles that are placed on the Union market. The Commission shall transmit thatevaluation, including where appropriate proposals for follow-up measures, such as legislativeproposals, to the European Parliament and the Council.Do no significant harm assessment"

"Brief rationale:Road freight transport with zero direct emissions vehicles (e.g. electric,hydrogen) is eligible because the generation of these energy carriers isassumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future. The definition isaligned with the heavy duty CO2 regulation, which provides the most recentlegislative point of orientation. Road freight transport with low-emission heavyduty vehicles defined in the same regulation and dedicated vehicles solelyusing a narrowly defined range of bio- or other renewable fuels are also eligibledue to the relatively high challenges in electrifying this vehicle category.Substantial contribution to climate mitigation from fuel substitution is in line withthe agreed taxonomy regulation.343"

Rationale
CO2e emissions per passenger- kilometre (gCO2e/pkm).
"Zero tailpipe emission vehicles (incl. hydrogen, fuel cell, electric) areautomatically eligible.Dedicated vehicles solely using advanced biofuels or renewable liquid andgaseous transport fuels of non-biological origin as defined in Art. 2 (34)and Art. 2 (36) in line with Directive (EU) 2018/2001), guaranteed eitherby technological design or ongoing monitoring and third-party verification.In addition, for an investment in new vehicles, only vehicles with efficiencycorresponding to direct emissions below 95g CO2 e /pkm (includingbiogenic CO2) are eligible.. Eligibility should be reviewed latest by 2025, orwhen Directive (EU) 2018/2001) is reviewed.Other vehicles are eligible if direct emissions are below 50 gCO 2e/pkm"
"Brief rationale:Passenger transport with zero tailpipe emissions vehicles (e.g. electric, hydrogen)is eligible because the generation of these energy carriers is assumed to becomelow or zero carbon in the near future. Dedicated vehicles solely using a narrowlydefined range of bio- or other renewable fuels are also eligible due to the relativelyhigh challenges in electrifying the vehicle category typically used on interurbanroutes. Substantial contribution to climate mitigation from fuel substitution is in linewith the agreed taxonomy regulation. The threshold of 50gCO2e/pkm relates tothe thresholds set for passenger cars (assuming occupancy of one) andrepresents a value that is significantly below average new car emissions.RationaleThe threshold of 50 gCO2e/pkm until 2025 ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar tocriteria for eligible road vehicles with low occupation factor (50 gCO 2/vkm) and significantly lowerthan average diesel car (290 gCO2/vkm367). The criteria is based on actual ridership (passenger-km)and not capacity offered (seat-km or places-km). This should be justified through real monitoringdata from operations or ex-ante demand assessments.Unlike urban buses, zero tailpipe emission vehicle technologies are not commercially available,therefore the threshold should be reviewed in or prior to 2025, rather than specifying now that onlyzero direct emissions will be eligible at that point, to analyze the modal shift comparison with cars ininterurban transport, and technology developments in the sector.With no commercial availability of zero tailpipe emission vehicles for this activity, fuel substitution toadvanced biofuels and renewable synthetic fuels are considered a relevant mitigation option forsome transport modes in the medium term as identified in the EC Long term strategy368:“for those transport modes where the deployment of zero emission vehicles is unfeasible due toenergy density requirements or technology costs, carbon neutral fuels (i.e. advanced biofuels andbiomethane, as well as e-fuels) can be deployed for use in conventional vehicle engines”."
"367 The factor represents urban operational emissions for the current average car in the vehicle stock (weighting the share ofdiesel, petrol, LPG, CNG, hybrid in the fleet). It does not represent emissions of new vehicles.

"The construction and operation of transport infrastructure is eligible in thefollowing cases:1. Infrastructure that is required for zero direct emissions water transport(e.g. batteries or hydrogen fuelling facilities) is eligible2. Infrastructure dedicated to supporting the renewable energy sector3. Infrastructure that is predominantly used for low-carbon transport iseligible if the fleet that uses the infrastructure meets the thresholds fordirect emissions as defined in the relevant activity - measured in CO2eemissions per passenger-kilometre (gCO2e/pkm),per tonne-kilometre(gCO2e/tkm), per passenger nautical mile (gCO2e/pnm) or per tonnenautical mile (gCO2e/tnm). 396For all cases:"
Only infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation of the transportservice is eligible.Infrastructure that is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or blendedfossil fuels is not eligible
Brief rationaleThe construction and operation of infrastructure for low carbon water transport isconsidered eligible because this is considered a key enabling factor for improvingthe uptake of the transport activities that are considered eligible under the rest ofthe land transport section of the Taxonomy. Eligibility for infrastructure is linked to
"396 At this stage, only criteria for inland waterway transport passenger and freight fleets are defined. The criteria for infrastructurecould not be applied to non-zero direct emissions maritime shipping fleets until criteria for that type of activity is defined."

"eligibility criteria for fleets using the infrastructure, with additional criteria relating toinfrastructure supporting the renewable energy sector.RationaleThe construction and operation of infrastructure for low carbon water transport is considered eligiblebecause this is considered a key enabling factor for improving the uptake of the activitiesconsidered eligible under the rest of the water transport section of the Taxonomy.Criteria 2 is a supply chain activity for renewable energy. It includes for example port facilitiesdedicated to supporting the offshore wind power sector.In criteria 3 above, “predominantly used for” should be interpreted to mean that the majority of theuse of the infrastructure is by fleets meeting the substantial contribution criteria in other watertransport activities identified in the taxonomy. Where there may be greater uncertainty in fleet usee.g. estimations based on future projections, a more conservative approach should be applied toensure that the predominant use requirement will be met.There is requirement that only infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation of the transportservice is eligible. Infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation are those infrastructure that areneeded to ensure the day-to-day delivery of a transport service e.g. fuelling/charging facilities. Itdoes not include ancillary infrastructure that do not directly ensure delivery of the operation of thefleet e.g. head offices of the transport operator.For the criteria that “infrastructure that is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or blended fossilfuels is not eligible”, the term “dedicated” is defined as infrastructure being built and acquired withthe explicit intention to transport or store fossil fuels, even if actual use may serve other purposes aswell.It is acknowledged that embedded carbon emissions in infrastructure projects (e.g. upstreamemissions from manufacture of construction materials) can be significant. The level of uncertaintyaround data in this respect makes it challenging at this time to incorporate this consideration withinthresholds for infrastructure. However, this element should be considered for ongoing work on theTaxonomy.Transport of fossil fuels is considered to have potential negative impacts on climate change andtherefore is excluded.ICT infrastructure meeting the criteria above is eligible i.e. it meets one of the stated criteria and isfundamental to the operation of the transport service. However, it is recognised that wider ICTactivities in transport may have substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and this willrequire future work to define criteria.Do no significant harm assessmentThe main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from water infrastructureactivities are attributed to the alteration of hydromorphology due to dredging, maintenance activitiesand construction of new infrastructures and waterways, as well as impact on biodiversity andecosystems from such activities.(2) Adaptation"

"Why is ICT included in the TaxonomyAnalysis by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) on the EU ICT sector398 – based on2015 data – assesses that its Value Added amounted to 581 billion euros, it employed 5.8 million people,spent 30 billion euros on R&D, and represented 3.9% of the EU value added, 2.5% of total employment,and 15.7% of total R&D. The ICT service sector in particular represented 3.6% of GDP. In general, theICT sector in 2015 was more dynamic than the whole EU economy, as value added increased 5.2%,employment 1.8% and R&D 2.9%However, based on the estimates published by the “European Framework Initiative for Energy &Environmental Efficiency in the ICT Sector”399 ICT currently accounts for 8-10% of the European electricityconsumption.The demand for telecommunications services is consistently growing.

Updates to DNSH criteria
"Comments received for the activities proposed as areas for further work are discussed in the relevantsections below.Setting criteria and thresholdsData centresThe JRC estimated total annual energy consumption of data centres in Western Europe as 56 TWh (or2% of the total electricity consumption) per year. In 2012, this was projected to increase to 104 TWh (or4%) per year by 2020. The large consumption of energy is due to the need for permanent storage of data(24 hour availability, back-up generators, etc.) and the need for cooling of the servers and otherequipment to maintain optimal operating temperatures 401.Considering this economic activity’s dependence on electricity, in a long-term scenario of decarbonizedbut limited energy from the grid, the sector mitigation potential has been identified in high standards ofenergy efficiency rather than in low carbon footprints.Given the complexity of data centres – which encompass hardware, software, cooling systems,monitoring and back-up energy systems, only to name a few components – and the trade-offs that arepresent in the industry between energy efficiency and reliability and security, the TEG has opted for acomprehensive approach setting as “threshold” for significant contribution to mitigation a data centrecompliance with the more advanced standard of energy efficiency available for this sector, the BestPractice Guidelines for the EU Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency (JRC) updated everyyear by the Commission to take account of technological advances402.Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductionsDespite the almost negligible contribution to the economy, data driven solution for data collection,transmission and modelling of GHG emissions reductions-related information plays an important enablingrole. Given the nature of the activity, no threshold are necessary.Next stepsThe TEG recommends that the Commission undertakes work on the following activities."

"Telecommunication networksThe International Energy Agency (IEA) 403has developed two different electricity demand and energyefficiency scenarios for data transmission networks (fixed+mobile) in 2021. The first scenario assumes amoderate rate of improvement in energy efficiency of 10% per year (which is close to conservativeestimates of historical improvements) and the other assumes a more rapid rate of improvement of 20%per year. In the moderate efficiency-improvement scenario, the midpoint of the electricity demand rangein 2021 rises by over 70% to about 320 TWh.To ensure significant contribution to climate change mitigation, the TEG has considered setting athreshold in terms of energy efficiency for each type of communication network, based on environmentaland energy efficiency standard as set by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)404which fully take into account the complexity and diversity of telecommunication networks. Therecommended threshold would be set at the top 10% – meaning that only the networks belonging to thetop decile in their category for energy efficiency would qualify as Taxonomy-eligible.This “best-in- class” approach is different from the incremental or mitigation approach advocated by a fewstakeholders, who recommend defining significant contribution in terms of incremental improvement inenergy efficiency compared to a previous baseline at every company. For example, a move from 4G to5G – which implies a 15% improvement in energy efficiency - would qualify for the definition of significantcontribution to mitigation.Considering the potential use of the taxonomy, this approach would not be helpful for investors who needto compare equity investments, and need to benchmark companies against each other, and not against aprevious state.Example of activities in scope based on this alternative approach:"
Upgrading of telecommunication networks to new generation
Energy efficiency and management in existing telecommunication networks
"Based on this alternative approach, threshold should for example be set in terms of “attaining at least15% energy saving compared to the energy consumption measured before the eligible project wasimplemented”.The EU could explore the option to adjust the 10% threshold, in the context of the whole Taxonomy."

"SoftwareThe energy efficiency of software and programming languages is an emerging area of research which isstarting to grab the attention of academics 405. The TEG recommends that the Commission develop a codeof conduct (similar to the one published for data centres) to ensure that best practices are identified andstandards adopted by the software industry.Context-specific digitalisation solutions for resource efficiencyDefined as development and/or use of integrated systems i.e. combination of software and hardware, orsoftware applications that minimize resource consumption in other sectors of the economy, thesedigitilasion solution are essential to ensure that other sectors of the economy – agriculture, energy,transport, buildings – meet the eligibility criteria set for other sectors’ inclusion in the EU Taxonomy.Examples include:"
Transport: Electric-vehicle smart charging - manage EV charging stations smartly to leverage on theextra storage capacity connected to the grid.
"Agriculture: Precision agriculture digital solutions – allow, for example, for the right amount of waterfor irrigation, or fertiliser use."
Energy: Innovative grid equipment (e.g. short circuit breakers) to ensure security in grids withgrowing decentralised renewable production. 406
"Stakeholders have also flagged the possibility to use avoided emissions to inform thresholds. However, inthe absence of established benchmarks for the accounting of avoided emissions for these sectors as partof the EU PEF and OEF harmonised methodology for the calculation of the environmental footprint ofproducts and organisations methods, this should be left to future iterations of the Taxonomy."

CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES
"PreambleIn the EU, buildings are effectively the largest energy consuming sector, responsible for around 40% ofenergy consumption and 36% of carbon emissions. 407 At the same time, embodied carbon emissions areincreasing and receiving growing attention. About three-quarters of European buildings are consideredinefficient, while only 0.4-1.2% (depending on the country) of the building stock is renovated each year toimprove its efficiency408. Renovation rates must be increased in order to set the whole building stock on anet-zero emissions pathway, while embodied and operational carbon emissions of new buildings must besignificantly reduced in order to minimise their impact over their life cycle. At the same time, designing andrenovating buildings to high energy performance standards is not sufficient to ensure low carbon emissionsduring operations, thus more needs to be done to address the ‘performance gap’ 409 of efficient buildings.Within this context, the TEG acknowledged the need for an ambitious approach and the crucial role thatthe taxonomy can play in directing financial flows towards the decarbonisation of the built environment.Subjects coveredThe taxonomy distinguishes four ‘economic activities’ and defines consistent mitigation criteria that enableassessing the eligibility of investments in construction and real estate on the basis of their potential impacton building energy performance and thus carbon emissions. The four activities are designed to be relevantto most real estate market participants and facilitate investment flows to mitigation measures in the buildingsector:1. Construction of new buildings: this activity covers real estate development and enables accounting of:a. project capital expenditures of developers and construction clients as eligible ‘low-carbonactivities’;b. turnover of developers and contractors.2. Building renovation: this activity covers comprehensive renovation and enables accounting of:a. project capital expenditures for renovation as eligible ‘transition activities’.i. When expenditures can be distinguished by type, at least 50% must be related to energyefficiency measures in order to consider the renovation expenditures as eligible in theirentirety. 410ii. When expenditures cannot be distinguished by type, 50% of the total renovationexpenditures may be counted as the proxy representing energy-efficiency measures."

"b. turnover of contractors.3. Individual measures and professional services: this activity covers technical interventions aimed atincreasing energy efficiency and professional services that are functional to energy improvements, andenables accounting of:a. project capital expenditures of clients as eligible ‘transition activities’;b. turnover of installers and services providers.4. Acquisition and ownership: this activity covers the purchase and management of buildings, and enablesaccounting of:a. project capital expenditures of the buyer/owner as eligible ‘transition activities’ or ‘low carbonactivities’ depending on building performance;b. turnover of real estate brokers and facility managers.Setting criteria and thresholdsThe TEG faced several challenges to develop appropriate Mitigation criteria for the construction and realestate sectors:"
"The lack of consistent and comparable data across countries for benchmarking building stockperformance and setting suitable thresholds for the top performing buildings within the respectivenational stock.The inherent difficulty of creating a level playing field across countries with different climates anddegrees of market readiness. Compared to other economic activities, the operation of individualbuildings has unique characteristics, which means the performance of different assets cannot easilybe compared. Due to climatic differences across regions, buildings in different locations havedifferent energy needs for heating, air conditioning and lighting, and therefore different potential tocontribute to climate change mitigation. Furthermore, the nature of the existing building stock variessignificantly from country to country, and even from region to region, due to differences in design,construction techniques and building age.The desire to find a compromise between rising ambition and building upon already existing ‘green’financing instruments. The financing of buildings and building energy improvements is the mostdeveloped segment of the green finance market, and the ownership of buildings in portfolios is anextensively practiced economic activity. As the Taxonomy is introduced to the market, it is importantto maintain the volume of existing investors and enable them to use the Taxonomy to evaluate theirportfolios.The intention to direct finance towards new buildings designed to higher standards than mandatorydesign and construction requirements, considering the varying levels of ambition and rigorregarding the implementation of nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB) across EU Member States.411"
"The necessity to acknowledge existing high-performing buildings built before 2021 through apractical best-in-class approach, due to a lack of transparency on national performancerequirement levels.The urgent need to increase the number of energy renovations, especially in private households."
"411 According to Article 9 of the EPBD, by 31 December 2020 all new buildings must be NZEB."
368
"Meanwhile, stakeholders’ feedback on the first version of the taxonomy report highlighted the followingissues:"
"The need to foster energy-efficient operations of buildings through performance monitoring andreporting, while considering practicality and privacy requirements.The need to ensure minimum safeguards across the building life cycle through DNSH criteria byadopting EU and international standards and considering the practical implications ofdemonstrating taxonomy eligibility across different building type and activities.The current inability of significant parts of the market to operate with carbon metrics, as well as theneed to progress towards the adoption of such metrics in conjunction with energy metrics."
"Taking into account these challenges and feedback, the TEG agreed on a specific strategy:"
"Setting criteria for new constructions to raise above mandatory design requirements and progresstowards net-zero emissions in the use phase by 2030, and work to introduce a requirement onincluding embodied carbon."
"Setting criteria to direct finance towards a large volume of major renovation projects as well astowards individual measures aimed at improving energy and carbon performance.Adopting a best-in-class approach to ensure that the acquisition and ownership criteria supportboth significant market uptake and sufficient environmental benefits. Encouraging buyers to acquireefficient buildings over less-efficient ones can also provide an opportunity to support substantialcontribution to climate mitigation by increasing the demand for such buildings and by enablingbuyers to consume less energy during the use phase. The TEG considers that the best-in-classapproach can be approximated by benchmarking the top performing 15% of the existing nationalstock. This performance level is intended to decline following 2050 decarbonisation targets. Theperformance of the top performing 15%of the national stock needs to be transposed into absoluteenergy or carbon metrics, but the TEG considered that data is not yet adequately available."
"Requiring improvements over time to ensure overall stock decarbonisation. The TEG is aware thatthere will be limited long-term impact in terms of emission reductions if the market simply tradesfinancial exposure in the top 15% of national stocks without improving the energy efficiency of suchbuildings through renovation. In fact, there may be a risk of undermining renovation efforts iffinancing acquisition becomes less onerous than financing energy efficiency measures. For thisreason, the TEG recommends introducing a requirement to renovate assets that are acquiredthough financial instruments that have long tenure periods."
Setting additional criteria on performance monitoring to ensure that large non-commercialproperties are efficiently operated and deliver real energy and carbon savings.
"These principles led the TEG to develop the following criteria to identify environmentally sustainableactivities in terms of Substantial Contribution to Climate Change Mitigation:1. Construction of new buildings: to be eligible, the design and construction of new buildings needsto ensure a net primary energy demand that is at least 20% lower than the level mandated bynational regulations. This is assessed through the calculated energy performance of the building,i.e. performance forecasted on the basis of modelling building physics under typical climatic andoccupancy conditions."
369
"This criterion is meant to be subject to reviews in the transitional decade 2020-2030 in order to takeinto account potential tightening of NZEB requirements by EU Member States, with the aim ofsetting the whole sector on convergence towards net-zero energy and carbon targets by 2030.2. Building renovations: renovations designed to meet the local national or regional requirementsfor ‘major renovation’ as defined in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)412; thiswill stimulate the market and encourage building owners undertaking a ‘conventional’ renovation toinclude energy-efficiency measures established by EU Member States in national and regionalregulations implementing the EPBD.In alternative, renovations are eligible if undertaken to ensure at least 30% savings in net primaryenergy demand in comparison to the baseline energy performance of the building before therenovation, assessed through the calculated energy performance of the building.3. Individual measures and professional services: measures and services aimed at reducingenergy and/or carbon emissions in buildings. This is assessed through technical requirements foreach measure and service.4. Acquisition and ownership: buildings built after 2021 are eligible if they meet the criteria for the‘Construction of new buildings’, while buildings built before 2021 are eligible if their performance iscomparable to the performance of the top 15% of the national stock, in terms of calculated PrimaryEnergy Demand during the use phase. An additional requirement is applied only to large nonresidential buildings (built both before and after 2021) to ensure efficient operations through energymanagement."
"With regards to the criteria established for Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to the other 5 environmentalobjectives, in the interest of practicality and ease of market application the TEG has opted to rely on EUpolicy and regulations when possible. The TEG is conscious that the DNSH criteria to climate changeadaptation requires extensive clarification in terms of its implementation in practice.Market coverageExcept for buildings used for the extraction, storage, transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels, thetaxonomy does not exclude any particular type of building, and therefore covers virtually the whole marketfor construction and real estate activities 413. This does not mean that every activity will be eligible, only thatany participant in the market can use the taxonomy to assess the eligibility of his/her investments relatedto buildings.The Mitigation criteria will impact EU Member States differently as the share of the market eligible underthe taxonomy will vary from location to location due to differences in the ‘levels of ambition’ established bynational regulations (definition of NZEB and minimum energy performance requirements andimplementation of the EPBD) for new and existing buildings undergoing and renovations. Buildings incountries with a highly decarbonised electricity grid will have an inherent advantage in delivering net-zerocarbon buildings."
"412 According to Article 7 of the EPBD buildings undergoing major renovation must meet the cost-optimal minimum energyperformance requirements.413 With the exemption of Article 4, paragraph 4 of the EPBD which allows EU Member States to exclude specific types of buildingsfrom the applying the minimum energy performance requirements."
370
"For renovations, differences in the minimum energy performance requirements set for ‘major renovations’across EU Member States imply that the Mitigation criteria will be easier to meet in some countries.However, it should be considered that requirements for ‘major renovations’ have been established byMember States on the basis of local climatic and building stock conditions as well as cost-optimalitycalculations and will be to be updated in the future.Outside the EU, the share of the market that could be eligible will also vary from country to country.Countries with ambitious building regulations that are accepted as taxonomy-equivalent will more easily beable to make large shares of their market eligible. The principle of the top performing 15% of the nationalstock provides a methodology to demonstrate eligibility of the non-EU best in class building stock.For renovations, the 30% energy savings threshold (alternative to the compliance with ‘major renovation’requirements) will not only facilitate immediate functionality of the taxonomy outside the EU, it will alsomake a significant part of renovation activities eligible, even in countries where national building regulationsmay not be ambitious enough. Moreover, the share of the market that could be eligible outside EU MemberStates will also depend on the local proliferation of taxonomy-eligible sustainability certification schemes.Impact of proposalsUptake if the taxonomy among market participants will have both beneficial and adverse effects on thesector. By enabling owners and developers to access dedicated ‘green’ financial instruments, the taxonomywill stimulate much needed investment in the renovation of buildings with lower levels of energyperformance as the well as construction of new energy-efficient buildings and the efficient operation ofexisting buildings. Market participants who do not upgrade their practices in line with taxonomy criteria maylose competitiveness and the ability to brand their economic activities and products as ‘green’. The TEGacknowledges the risk of creating stranded assets but considers that by creating different paths toaccessing finance, sufficient safeguards have been included in the criteria to adequately manage thispossibility.In terms of implementation costs, the taxonomy will affect market participants differently. Meeting eligibilitycriteria for new constructions, renovations and acquisitions may result in additional costs in comparison tobusiness-as-usual practices. These additional costs can be counterbalanced over time through theexpected energy savings and the wider benefits (on health, comfort, lower volume of energy consumptionand reduced energy bills, etc) associated with high-performing buildings. Market participants may also incurfurther costs due to the process required to demonstrate eligibility with taxonomy criteria, especially whenthe latter are based on several technical parameters. However, these parameters have been largely basedon international standards and EU regulations to take into account usability issues, considering also thedifferences between the residential and commercial sectors.Overall, considering the importance and urgency of improving the energy performance and decarbonisingthe building stock, the impact of implementation costs can be considered proportionate to the goals of thetaxonomy, especially as successful taxonomy uptake will also have significant positive social and economicimpacts. Requiring high standards for new buildings and renovating existing ones will reduce energy billsand improve indoor air quality and thermal comfort, positively impacting occupants’ health and availableincome. Requiring high standards will also stimulate the demand for sustainability professionals, serviceproviders and skilled construction workers, thus creating employment and upskilling opportunities. Theeligibility of individual measures and professional services will also boost the market for energy efficiency,"

Eligibility of measures such as the installation of electricvehicle charging stations will facilitate an integrated cross-sectoral approach with the transport sector.Recommendations for future developmentsThe TEG acknowledges the need to review and update the criteria identified in this report and encouragesthe Sustainable Finance Platform to agree on a timeline for this purpose. Consistency of criteria across thefour activities should be maintained in future iterations of the taxonomy.The TEG strongly recommends the following actions in order to develop a taxonomy capable of fullycovering the contribution that the built environment can bring to climate change mitigation:
"The Sustainable Finance Platform should establish a timeline for reviewing the 20% relativeimprovement from NZEB requirements (which applies to the ‘Construction of new buildings’), inconjunction with the expected updates of NZEB regulations by EU Member States, and with theclear objective of converging towards net-zero energy and net-zero carbon targets for new buildingsby 2030. Such targets are aligned with the strategies of the World Green Building Council 414, theGlobal Alliance for Buildings and Construction415 and other organisations416. Buildings built between2021 and 2050 will represent up to 23% of the total stock in 2050 417. If the entire stock is meant tobe net-zero carbon by 2050, it follows that those buildings built between 2021 and 2050 must benet-zero carbon in order for the overall target to be met. The sooner new buildings are built withnet-zero performance, the less difficult it will be to meet the 2050 target for the whole sector to benet-zero. Since the TEG recommends working towards the introduction of net-zero carbon onlyafter 2030, this already constitutes a compromise between the urgent need to eliminate emissionsfrom new constructions and the capacity of the real estate sector to deliver net-zero carbonbuildings.Considering the updates of NZEB regulations by EU Member States (expected in 2023 and 2028),the timeline for the Sustainable Finance platform could be as follows:o"
"2023: review of threshold, considering tightening of NZEB requirements;"
o
"2025: review of threshold, if necessary;"
o
"2028: review of threshold, considering tightening of NZEB requirements;"
o
2030: introduction and technical definition of net-zero energy and net-zero carbonrequirements.
"Where net-zero carbon is already mandated by regulation (as may be the case for some buildingtypes in some Member States), the taxonomy should not require better performance, since netzero carbon can be considered sufficient (from the side of new constructions) to allow the entirebuilding stock to be climate-neutral by 2050."
"Although the reduction of carbon embodied in buildings has been often neglected in favour ofreducing carbon emissions arising during operations, awareness of their importance is quickly"

"growing among built environment professionals, while methods and tools for embodied carbonassessment based on LCA are becoming more widespread. Notably, a large share of emissionsembodied in buildings takes place during resource extraction and product manufacturing, beforebuildings are even occupied, which means that all new constructions begin their lifecycle with asignificant amount of embodied carbon.The Sustainable Finance Platform should gather and analyse existing data in order to establishreliable thresholds for carbon emission embodied in new constructions, which will be integratedinto the taxonomy criteria for the activity ‘Construction of new buildings’ as additional threshold tobe met. These thresholds should be based on a wide and consistent set of data, suitable forbenchmarking best practice across different building uses and typologies (i.e. houses, flats, offices,etc.), thus the Sustainable Finance Platform should encourage and support the generation of suchdata. The Sustainable Finance Platform should progress this work with the aim of introducingthresholds for embodied carbon by 2025.In parallel, the methodology adopted to assess embodied emissions should be defined in detailwith reference to widely accepted LCA and CEN/TC350 standards, with particular attention towardsadequately recognising the beneficial impact of carbon sequestration in timber products sourcedfrom sustainably managed forests."
"By the end of 2024, the Sustainable Finance Platform should establish absolute thresholds forenergy and carbon emissions to represent the performance of the top 15% of national stocks andprovide a clear decarbonisation pathway as threshold for assessing the acquisition and ownershipof assets built before 2021. By then, the performance of the top 15% of each national stock willhave been converted into absolute thresholds for energy and carbon emissions. Until 31 December2025, the top 15% of the national stock represents the performance level required to be eligible,From that date onward, and every five years afterwards, the performance level should be loweredto reflect a pathway reaching net-zero operational carbon in 2050. Such pathway could look asfollows:o"
"Until 2025: X kgCO2eq/m2y, corresponding to the performance of the top 15% of thenational stock"
o
2026-2030: (5/6)*X kgCO2eq/m2y
o
2031-2035: (4/6)*X kgCO2eq/m2y
o
2036-2040: (3/6)*X kgCO2eq/m2y
o
2041-2045: (2/6)*X kgCO2eq/m2y
o
2046-2050: (1/6)*X kgCO2eq/m2y
o
From 2051: net-zero kgCO2eq/m2y
"The Sustainable Finance Platform should consider how to address long-term eligibility, i.e. assetscovered by financial instruments with a tenure period of ten years or more. These assets could berequired to be renovated in order to maintain eligibility. For example, there could be a requirementfor renovations to occur within 15 years from the acquisition date."
"The Sustainable Finance Platform should provide guidance on the practical implementation of theDNSH criteria to climate change adaptation, especially for the activity of building renovation takinginto account the need to avoid disproportionate administrative and financial burden."
"The Sustainable Finance Platform should develop appropriate criteria and thresholds to addresscarbon emissions arising from unregulated energy use (i.e. plug-in electric loads) in buildings,373"
"considering different building typologies. Emissions due to unregulated energy use are not currentlycovered by the criteria established in this report, but these emissions can represent a significantshare of the operational impact of buildings, especially from specific non-residential typologies. Toshorten the process and avoid the duplication of efforts, these thresholds could be developed onthe basis of the decarbonisation trajectories identified in the research project Carbon Risk RealEstate Monitor (CRREM), funded by Horizon 2020."
The Sustainable Finance Platform should periodically review and update the list of eligibleindividual measures and professional activities.
"The Sustainable Finance Platform should develop appropriate criteria and thresholds to addressScope 1 emissions of construction companies, i.e. emission that are associated with the operationof such firms and the associated construction works."
The Platform should ensure future alignment of the existing Individual Measures with the low-carbontechnology list within the Manufacturing sector.

Mitigation criteriaPrinciple
"The construction of new buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbonemissions throughout the lifecycle can make a substantial contribution to climatechange mitigation by saving large part of the energy and carbon emissions thatwould be associated with conventionally designed buildings.Condition for non-eligibility: to avoid lock-in and undermining the climatemitigation objective, the construction of new buildings designed for the purpose ofextraction, storage, transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels is not eligible.Use of alternative schemes as proxies: outside EU Member States, establishedschemes such as ‘green building’ certifications or building regulations andstandards may be used as alternative proof of eligibility, provided that this isverified by the Sustainable Finance Platform. The organisation responsible for thescheme will be able to apply for official recognition of its scheme by presentingevidence that a specific level of certification/regulation can be consideredequivalent (or superior) to the taxonomy mitigation and DNSH threshold for therelevant climatic zone and building type. The Sustainable Finance Platform willassess the evidence and approve or reject the application."
Metric andthreshold
"The metric is Primary Energy Demand (PED), defining the energy performance ofa building: the annual primary energy demand associated with regulated energyuse during the operational phase of the building life-cycle (i.e. ‘module B6’ asdefined in EN15978), calculated ex-ante according to the national methodologiesfor asset design assessment, or as defined in the set of standards ISO 52000,expressed as kWh/m2 per year.The threshold is based on ‘nearly zero-energy building’ (NZEB) requirements,which are defined in national regulation implementing the EPBD and aremandatory for all new buildings across EU Member States from 2021. To beeligible, the net primary energy demand of the new construction must be at least20% lower than the primary energy demand resulting from the relevant NZEBrequirements.418 This reduction can be met through a direct decrease of the"
"The PED is either directly expressed by NZEB requirements or is derived by applying those requirements and calculating theresulting PED. When NZEB requirements specify a PED, the percentage improvement should be applied to this figure.418"

"primary energy demand via a more efficient design or by offsetting with on-siteand off-site renewable generation, or a combination of both strategies. Off-siteenergy generation must be limited to district heating and cooling systems andlocal renewable energy sources. 419The methodology used for the measurement of floor area should be statedreferring to the categories defined in the International Property MeasurementStandards.420RationaleThe establishment of a relative threshold in the form of a percentage improvement on NZEBrequirements is justified by the fact that from 2021 new constructions will be mandated bynational/regional building regulations to comply with NZEB requirements. This implies that thetaxonomy must require better levels of performance than NZEB, or all new constructions would beautomatically eligible, which would fail to direct finance towards more sustainable solutions and runthe risk of diverting finance from the renovation of existing buildings. Since NZEB requirementscorrespond to different levels of performance across EU Member States , the use of a percentageimprovement, rather than absolute figures, allows a degree of proportionality to be applied: inMember States where NZEB requirements result in a comparatively low PED, the energy reductionnecessary to achieve the 20% improvement is smaller than in Member States where NZEBrequirements result in a comparatively high primary energy demand.Do no significant harm assessmentThe main potential for significant harm to the other environmental objectives associated with theconstruction of new buildings is determined by:"
"Lack of resistance to extreme weather events (including flooding), and lack of resilience tofuture temperature increases in terms of internal comfort conditions.Excessive water consumption due to inefficient water appliances.Landfill and/or incineration of construction and demolition waste that could be otherwiserecycled/reused.Presence of asbestos and/or substances of very high concern in the building materials.Presence of hazardous contaminants in the soil of the building site.Inappropriate building location: impacts on ecosystems if built on greenfield and especially ifin a conservation area or high biodiversity value area.Indirect damage to forest ecosystems due to the use of timber products originating formforests that are not sustainably managed."

The SustainableFinance Platform will assess the evidence and approve or reject the application."
Metric andthresholds
"The thresholds used to assess the renovation rely on either the respectivemetrics set in the applicable building energy performance regulation for ‘majorrenovation’ transposing the EPBD, or, in the case of relative improvement, onPrimary Energy Demand (PED) defined as follows: the annual primary energydemand associated with regulated energy use during the operational phase ofthe building life-cycle (i.e. ‘module B6’ according to EN15978), calculated ex-anteaccording to the national methodologies for asset design assessment, or asdefined in the set of standards ISO 52000, expressed as kWh/m2 per year.A renovation is eligible when it meets either one of the following thresholds:"
379
"a) Major renovation428: the renovation is compliant with the requirementsset in the applicable building regulations for ‘major renovation’transposing the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). Theenergy performance of the building or the renovated part upgraded mustmeet cost-optimal minimum energy performance requirements inaccordance with the EPBD.b) Relative improvement: the renovation leads to reduction of PrimaryEnergy Demand of at least 30% in comparison to the energyperformance of the building before the renovation.429 The initial energyperformance and the estimated improvement shall be based on aspecialised building survey and validated by an Energy PerformanceCertificate, an energy audit conducted by an accredited independentexpert or any other transparent and proportionate method.The methodology used for the measurement of floor area should be statedreferring to the categories defined in the International Property MeasurementStandards.430RationaleThe choice of a threshold based on the minimum energy performance requirements to be met bybuildings undergoing ‘major renovation’ is strongly affected by the necessity of substantiallyincreasing the annual rates of renovations that include energy-efficiency measures. Suchrequirements are established in EU Member States at national or regional level in buildingregulations implementing the EPBD and are based on calculations of cost-optimality. Access toadvantageous financing conditions is meant to incentivise homeowners and businesses toundertake a renovation that includes energy efficiency measures.The threshold for ‘relative improvement’ is given as alternative to allow the eligibility of renovationsthat may not meet the ‘major renovation’ requirements but still deliver considerable energy savings,as well as to provide a threshold that is easily applicable outside EU Member States.Since the focus of the criteria is the renovation project and not the building in itself, any renovationcan be eligible, independently from the absolute performance of the building as long as it meetseither one of the two thresholds.Do no significant harm assessment"
"428 ‘major renovation’ means the renovation of a building where:(a) the total cost of the renovation relating to the building envelope or the technical building systems is higher than 25 % of the valueof the building, excluding the value of the land upon which the building is situated; or(b) more than 25 % of the surface of the building envelope undergoes renovation;Member States may choose to apply option (a) or (b)429 The 30% improvement must result from an actual reduction in primary energy demand (i.e. reductions in net primary energydemand through renewable energy sources do not count), and can be achieved through a succession of measures within amaximum of 3 years430 International Property Measurement Standards (IPMS): https://ipmsc.org/"

Building acquisition and ownership: this activity relates to NACE code L68“Real estate activities”.
Mitigation criteriaPrinciple
"The acquisition of buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbonemissions throughout the lifecycle instead of lower-performing ones can make asubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation objectives. While specificdata on embodied carbon and thus carbon emissions from the full lifecycle is stilllimited and needs to be further generated, the acquisition of buildings designed tominimise energy use and carbon emissions during the use phase can alreadymake an important contribution by directing users towards high-performingproperties and by sending signals to markets about the need to lift the overallenergy performance of the whole stock.For large non-residential buildings (i.e. buildings with an effective rated output forheating systems or systems for combined space heating and ventilation of over290 kW, or buildings with floor area437 over 1000 m2), an additional requirement isintroduced to ensure that these buildings are operated efficiently, and that actualenergy and carbon savings are delivered each year.Condition for non-eligibility: to avoid lock-in and undermining the climatemitigation objective, the acquisition and ownership of buildings for the purpose ofextraction, storage, transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels are not eligible.Use of alternative schemes as proxies: outside EU Member States, establishedschemes such as ‘green building’ certifications or building regulations may beused as alternative proof of eligibility, provided that this is verified by theSustainable Finance Platform.

"Users of the Taxonomy should identify and explain which criteria they are responding to.Non-exhaustive list of examples of measures that can contribute to Adaptation of Forestryactivities:The activity itself can be made climate-resilient through different measures, such as:"
Use of early warning systems or wildfire control measures (to reduce damages due towildfires enhanced by heat waves);Use of regeneration material (species and ecotypes) less sensitive to strong wind or timelymanagement of seedling stand and timely thinning (to reduce damage to forest stands fromincreased wind);
Use of species and ecotypes less susceptible to drought or diversification of species and ecotypes (tominimise tree losses due to lack of water availability).Do no significant harm assessmentKey environmental aspects span across all other five objectives and are summarized as follows:
ensure the long-term ability of the forests to sequester carbon;
impact on water resources as well as on water quality;
"pollution to water, air, and soil, and risks associated from the use of pesticides and fertilizer;"
"456 Source: FAO, Global Forest Resources Assessment, 2020"
409
impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from intensification and conversion of land of highecological value to forests and illegal logging.
The DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of theforest mitigation Taxonomy (criterion 1). The criteria can be informed by applying forest certificationusing independent third-party schemes that are regularly audited. Compliance shall be reportedthrough a forest management plan (or equivalent) as per criterion 3 of the forest mitigationTaxonomy.(1) Mitigation
"Forests are an unusual economic sector in which they provide a substantialcarbon sink, and that significant harm for forest climate change mitigationinclude where an (adaptation) activity leads to a significant long-term reductionof the carbon sink. It is therefore important to maintain the forest area and thusforest carbon stocks and sink potential over the long-term. The principles forensuring mitigation proofed adaptation activities are that adaptation responsesshould:o"
Not undermine the long-term ability of the forests to sequestercarbon
o
"Not undermine the long-term maintenance of existing forestcarbon sinks, both above and below ground"
A criterion by which the activity can be judged as Taxonomy compliant is asfollows – in line with existing EU legislation:
(3) Water
"Adaptation responses shall comply with the requirement set out inArticle 29(7)b of the recast Renewable Energy Directive(EU/2018/2001) which determines the requirement for managementsystems to be in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure thatcarbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, orstrengthened over the long term457."
"Identify and manage risks related to water quality and/or waterconsumption at the appropriate level. Ensure that water use/conservationmanagement plans, developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders,have been developed and implemented."
"In the EU, fulfil the requirements of EU water legislation."
(4) CircularEconomy
"457 Article 29 of the recast RED, sets out sustainability criteria for forests to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forestare maintained, or strengthened over the long term. This is explicitly defined in Article 29(7)b which requires “…managementsystems are in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained, orstrengthened over the long term.” This places the emphasis of the no significant harm requirement at a level more appropriate forthe operation of the Taxonomy and/or investment, rather than relying on national level requirements."
410
(5) Pollution
(6) Ecosystems
"Minimise the use of pesticides and favour alternative approaches ortechniques, such as non-chemical alternatives to pesticides, in line with theDirective 2009/128/EC on the sustainable use of pesticides. With exceptionof occasions that this is needed to control pest and diseases outbreaks.Adapt the use of fertilizers to what is needed to prevent leeching ofnutrients to waters."
"Take well documented and verifiable measures to avoid the use of activeingredients that are listed in the Stockholm Convention, the RotterdamConvention, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the OzoneLayer, or that are listed as classification Ia or Ib in the WHO recommendedClassification of Pesticides by Hazard;"
Prevent pollution of water and soil in the forest concerned and undertakeclean up measures when it does happen.
Take measures to ensure sustained or improved long term conservationstatus at the landscape level458
"In designated conservation areas, actions should be demonstrated to be inline with the conservation objectives for those areas."
"No conversion of habitats specifically sensitive to biodiversity loss or ofhigh conservation value such as grasslands and any high carbon stockarea (e.g. peat lands and wetlands), and areas set aside for the restorationof such habitats in line with national legislation"
Develop a forest management plan (or equivalent) that includes provisionsfor maintaining biodiversity459
Evaluate the ecosystem service provision with the aim to not decrease theamount and quality of ecosystem services provided.
"Forests are monitored and protected to prevent illegal logging, incompliance with national laws"
"Promote close-to-nature forestry or similar concepts depending on thelocal requirements and limitations;Select native species or species, varieties, ecotypes and provenance oftrees that adequately provide the necessary resilience to climate change,natural disasters and the biotic, pedologic and hydrologic condition of thearea concerned, as well as the potential invasive character of the speciesunder local conditions, current and projected climate change."
458 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal to preserve conservation status for different species isat a scale above the single forest stand.459 This criterion should be considered in combination with criterion 3 of the mitigation criteria to disclose through a forest
management plan (or equivalent).

FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE ACTIVITIES
"BackgroundAccording to the World Economic Forum Report (2020), more common extreme weather events couldmake insurance unaffordable or simply unavailable for individuals and businesses. Globally, the‘catastrophe protection gap’ - what should be insured but is not – reached US$280 billion (EUR€252billion) in 2018596. The TEG is concerned to address the widening protection gap by classifyingselected non-life insurance lines of business (LOBs) as substantially contributing to ‘adaptation by’.The eligible economic activity substantially contributes to ‘adaptation by’ when it meets Principle B1.1whereby:“the activity reduces or facilitates adaptation to physical climate risks beyond the boundaries of theactivity itself. This includes activities that:a) Promote a new technology, product, practice or governance process or innovative uses of existingpractices (including those related to natural infrastructure); or,b) Remove information, financial, technological and capacity barriers to adaptation by others.”Non-life insurance eligible for the Taxonomy includes selected LOBs and insurance products andservices that provide cover for climate-related hazards to activities and/or assets that are Taxonomyaligned.As the number and range of sub-sectors eligible for the Taxonomy evolves arising from developmentof substantial contribution to the remaining four environmental objectives, additional activities willbecome eligible for Taxonomy aligned non-life insurance products. Furthermore, the TEG believesthat economic activities that may not be screened for substantial contribution to any of the sixenvironmental objectives, such as environmentally neutral activities (schools, hospitals, publicadministration services, etc.), which may nonetheless be impacted by climate change should beconsidered as potentially eligible for Taxonomy aligned non-life insurance. TEG recommends furtherconsideration of DNSH criteria for non-life insurance activities to enhance the coverage of activitiesand improve usability of the criteria."
